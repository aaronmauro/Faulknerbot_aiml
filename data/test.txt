is there any purpose in the repetition of the same types of characters throughout your writing
no only that i have led all of my life has been lived in a little mississippi town and there s not much variety there
a a writer writes from his experience his background in the terms of his imagination and his observation
that would be the explanation i think
sir inline with that some of your novels pickup characters where you left them off in other novels that you had written a good number of years before
for example most of the incidents involving the s nope s as i understand it were written from on and yet you ve come out with a book this year about the s nope s
do you find it difficult to over a period of years pickup those characters and carry their personalities through along the same vein
nono those characters tome are are quite real and quite constant
they are in my my mind all the time
i dont have any trouble at all going back to pickup one
i forget what they did but but the character i dont forget and when the book is finished that character is not done he s still going on at some new devilment that sooner or later i will find out about and write about
its been said that you write about the secret of the human heart
is there one major truth of the human heart
well that s a question almost metaphysical
i would say if there is one truth of the human heart it would be to believe in itself believe in its its capacity to aspire to be better than it is it might be
that it does exist in all people
sir it has been said that at certain points in the evolution of society an author is within the society describing his immediate surroundings and what he sees at that time but as that society degrades and goes down the author is thrown out and looks as an outsider on his society such that you might see when you look at the south
what do you feel is your position in society today
are you looking from within or are you out of the society looking at it objectively the south in particular
i think that im still apart of society
i think that as i grow older i know more and i see more understand more of what i see but iam as much involved in society as i was when i was a young man
i just just know more of what i see now because im older
in light of the question out here and your answer about writing about jefferson because that s what you know ive always been interested in why you switched then to france with a fable which is another treatment of the human heart
why did you feel that a european setting would be best for that theme
the fable was the only book i ever wrote on an idea and the idea was who might that man be under the splendid cenotaph with the eternal fire burning over him that if he had been christ returned again and crucified again for the second time then maybe we would have only one more chance
that was the only book i ever wrote from an idea and that idea had to since the idea was who might be under that cenotaph it had to take place in france
sirs iron the inside of the cover of a fable i read the comment that this work might possibly become a classic in the lifetime of the author
in ever finished the book and so i dont have an opinion of it to comment
do you care to comment
i dont think its a very good book because its as i say that s the only book i ever tried to write on ideas and im not an idea man
im not a cerebral man
i write from from from here and so i dont consider that a very good book myself it was the best i could do with the idea and i had to write it because the idea worried me
i was wondering whether charles bonin ab salom ab salom
ever had concluded who his father was s ut peni think he knew
i dont know whether he his mother probably told him
i think he knew was it a conscious knowledge would you say or an unconscious knowledge
probably it it was a conscious knowledge in the sense that his mother had told him who his father was
it maybe that he didnt believe it or didnt know or didnt care
i think i dont believe that he felt any affinity with s ut pen as father and son but probably his mother had told him and that she had been deserted and if anything if he did believe i the hated s ut pen of course
sir do you think according to nathaniel hawthorne the greatest s in was the violation of the human heart
would you say that you think along those lines as far as what the greatest s in could be or the greatest crimea character could commit
would you agree with that statement
yes yes i agree with that
she is the same person actually
yes she is the same personal actually
these people i figure belong to mean di have the right to move them about in time when i need the mmr
faulkner
throughout your work there seems to be a theme that theresa curse upon the south
i was wondering if you could explain what this curse is and if there s any chance of the south of escaping it
the the curse is slavery which is a an intolerable condition
no man shall be enslaved and the south has got to work work that curse out and it will if its let alone it it cant be compelled to do it
it it must do it of its own will and and desire which i believe it will do if its let alone sir along that line how will it do it and what will it do to adjust its relationship with the negro
will it take the negro into society or what will
no it will it will never take the negro into society
it will give the negro the right for equality which tome is something different
it will will teach the negro the responsibility of equality of the negros own people will teach him that
then he will will receive equality
he i think that the negro doesnt want to mix with the whiteman anymore than the whiteman wants to mix with the negro but ido think that the negro wants to be equal with the whiteman and have the right to that once once he has the same right to enter the whiteman s house that another whiteman does he wont want to that his grief is that he knows that he has not that right
no matter how clean he is or how intelligent he has not that right to enter the whiteman s restaurant the whiteman s hotel
once he has that right he wont want to
hell prefer his own i believe
sir so many of your books have certain characters of mixed blood
do you consider miscegenation absolute an absolute wrong or is it just a mistake with the current social
its no not wrong
its a mistake only in the current social scheme
there s there s no law that is going to prevent romeo and juliet no matter what color they are
there s no wrong in it
its simply a mistake and an error as conditions are now and an individual suffers because of it
that s the tragedy of it
in ab salom ab salom reaction tosu t pens marriage because of their concern for their because there s
im sorry
i couldnt hear that too well was the reaction of the people tosu t pens second marriage when they had noone showed up at the wedding was that reaction caused by peoples the peoples dislike of his life or his social errors or because of their not being told why where he go this money
oh he had violated the local more s
they they feared him and they hated him because of his ruthlessness
he made no pretence to be anything else except what he was and so he violated the local more s and they they ostracized him
not in revenge at all but simply because they wanted no part of s ut pen
you say that you feel that there is hope for the south yet the s nope ses have taken over frenchmen s bend fl em is president of the bank in jefferson
are those the men that are going to lead the south out of the darkness in
they are the men that can cope with the new industrial age but there will be something left as this we mentioned a while ago of of the old cavalier spirit that will appear that does appear i by cavaliers piri time an people who believe in in simple honor for the for the sake of honor and honesty for the sake of honesty do you think those people will band together or how do you think they will accomplish this feat
dont you feel that that there is a curse and that it should be removed
how do you feel that they will eventually overcome
they they wont band together
i doubt if people accomplish very much by banding together
people accomplish things by individual protest
is s ut pen meant to be a completely depraved character something like claggart in billy budd or iago in othello or is he meant to be pitied
tome he is to be pitied
he was not depraved he was amoral
he was ruthless completely self centered
tome he is to be pitied as anyone who ignores man is to be pitied who does not believe that he belongs as a member of of a human family of the human family is to be pitied
s ut pen didnt believe that
he was s ut pen
he was going to take what he wanted because he was big enough and strong enough and i think that people like that are destroyed sooner or later because one has got to belong to the human family and to take a responsible part in the human family
if you were to explain mechanization in the south after the civil war as a destructive force part of the degeneration do you think this is inherent of mechanization in a society when it shifts from an agrarian society or do you think this is because as a person in the south that it is this way in the south
well the south is apart of the united states and i think that we are the whole world is going through a tragic time now not because of mechanization but because we became slaves to the machines at which we invented formans good
instead of they being our slaves we are their slaves and we will have to but man is tougher even than the machine that he will will endure and will outlast the age in which that machine dominates
im sure were all very grateful to you for coming down and answering our questions this morning
thankyou sir
pap got up a good hour before daylight and caught the mule and rid down to kill e grew s to borrow the f roe and maul
he ought to been back with it in forty minutes
but the sun had rose and i had done milked and fed and was eating my breakfast when he got back with the mule not only in a lather but right on the edge of the thumps too
fox hunting he said
fox hunting
a seventy year oldman with both feet and one knee too already in the grave squatting all night on a hill and calling himself listening to a fox race that he couldnt even hear unless they had come right upon to the same log he was setting on and bayed into his ear trumpet give me my breakfast he told maw
whitfield is standing there right this minute straddle of that board tree with his watch in his hand
and he was we rid on past the church and there was not only solon quick s school bus truck but reverend whitfield sold mare too
we tied the mule to a sapling and hung our dinner bucket on a limb and with pap toting kill e grew sf roe and maul and the wedges and me toting our a x we went on to the board tree where solon and homer book wright with their f roes and mauls and axes and wedges was setting on two upended cuts and whitfield was standing jest like pap said in his boiled shirt and his black hat and pants and necktie holding his watch in his hand
it was gold and in the morning sunlight it looked as big as a full grow ed squash
you relate he said
so pap told them again about how oldman kill e grew had been off fox hunting all night and nobody at home to lend him the f roe but mr skille grew and the cook
and naturally the cook wasnt going to lend none of kill e grew stools out and mr skille grew was worse r deaf than even kill e grew
if you was to run in and tell her the house was a fire she would jest keep on rocking and says he thought so too unless she began to holler back to the cook to turn the dogs loose before you could even open your mouth
you could have gone yesterday and borrowed the f roe whitfield said
you have known for a month now that you had promised this one day out of a whole summer toward putting a roof on the house of god
we a in t but two hours late pap said
i reckon the lord will forgive i the a in t interested in time no how
he s interested in salvation
whitfield never even waited for pap to finish
it looked tome like he even got taller thundering down at pap like a cloudburst
he a in t interested in neither
why should he be when he owns them both
and why should he turnaround for the poor m izz ling souls of men that cant even borrow tools in time to replace the shingles on his church i dont know either
maybe its just because he made them
maybe he just said to himself i made the mi dont know why
but since i didi godfrey ill roll my sleeves up and drag them into glory whether they will or no
but that wasn there nor there neither now and i reckon he know edit jest like he know ed there wasnt going to be nothing at all here as long as he stayed
so he put the watch back into his pocket and motioned solon and homer up and we all taken of four hats except him while he stood there with his face raised into the sun and his eyes shut and his eyebrows looking big like iron gray caterpillars lying along the edge of a cliff
lord he said make them good straight shingles to lay smooth and let them split out easy they re for you and opened his eyes and looked at us again mostly at pap and went and untied his mare and clu mb up slow and stiff like old men do and rid away
pap put down the f roe and maul and laid the three wedges in an eat row on the ground and taken up the a x
well men he said lets get started
were already late
me and home rain t solon said
we was here
this time him and homer didnt seton the cuts
they squatted on their heels
then i seen that homer was whittling on a stick
i had nt noticed it before
i make it two hours and a little over solon said
more or less
pap was still about half stooped over holding the a x
its nigher one he said
but call it two for the sake of the argument
what about it
what argument
homer said
all right pap said
two hours then
what about it
which is three man hour units a hour multiplied by two hours solon said
or a total of six work units
when the wpa first come toyo k napa taw pha county and started to giving out jobs and grub and mattresses solon went into jefferson to get on it
he would drive his school bus truck the twenty two miles into town every morning and comeback that night
hedone that for almost a week before he found out he would not only have to sign his farm off into somebody else s name he couldnt even own and run the school bus that he had built himself
so he comeback that night and never went back no more and since then had nt nobody better mention wp and a to him unless they aimed to fight too though every now and then he would turn up with something all figured down into work units like hedone now
six units short
four of which you and homer could have already worked out while you was setting here waiting on me pap said
except that we didnt solon said
we promised whitfield two units of twelve three unit hours toward getting some new shingles on the church roof
we been here ever since sunup waiting for the third unit to show up so we could start
you dont seem to kept up with these modern ideas about work that s been flooding and uplifting the country in the last few years
what mod ren ideas
pap said
i didnt know there was but one idea about work until it is done it a in td one and when it is done it is
homer made another long steady whittle on the stick
his knife was sharp as a razor solon taken out his snuffbox and filled the top and tilted the snuff into his lip and offered the box to homer and homer shaken his head and solon put the top back on the box and put the box back into his pocket
so pap said jest because i had to wait two hours for a old seventy year man to get back from fox hunting that never had no more business setting out in the woods all night than he would a had setting all night in a highway juke joint we all three have got to comeback here tomorrow to finish them two hours that vo u and homer iain t solon said
i dont know about homer
i promised whitfield one day
i was here at sunup to start it
when the sun goes down i will consider i have done finished it
i see pap said
i see
its me that s got to comeback
by myself
i got to break into a full morning to makeup them two hours that you and homer spent resting
i got to spend two hours of the next day making up for the two hours of the day before that you and homer never even worked
its going to more than jest break into a morning solon said
its going to wreck it
there s six units leftover
six one man hour units
maybe you can work twice as fast as me and homer put together and finish them in four hours but i dont believe you can work three times as fast and finish in two
maybe there s something else besides cash you might be able to trade with solon said
you might use that dog
that was when pap actually stopped
i didnt know it myself the neither but i found out a good longtime before solon did
pap set there with the maul up over his head and the blade of the froese t against the block for the next lick looking up at solon
the dog
he said it was a kind of mixed hound with a little bird dog and some collie and maybe a considerable of almost anything else but it would ease through the woods without no more noise than ahan t and pickup a squirrels trail on the ground and bark jest once unless it know ed you was where you could see it and then tiptoe that trail out jest like a man and never make another sound until it treed and only then when it know ed you had nt kept insight of it
it belonged to pap and vernon tull together
will var ner give it to tull as a puppy and pa praised it for a half interest me and him trained it and it slept in my bed with me until it got sobig maw finally run it out of the house and for the last six months solon had been trying to buy it
him and tull had agreed on two dollars for tull s half of it but solon and pap was still six dollars apart on our n because pap said it was worth ten dollars of anybody s money and if tull wasnt going to collect his half of that he was going to collect it for him
so that s it pap said
them things wasnt work units at all
they was dog units
jest a suggestion solon said
jest a friendly offer to keep them runaway shingles from breaking up your private business for six hours tomorrow morning
you sell me your half of that trick overgrown fy ce and ill finish these shingles for you
naturally including them six extra units of one dollars pap said
nono solon said
ill pay you the same two dollars for your half of that dog that me and tull agreed on for his half of it
you meet me here tomorrow morning with the dog and you can goon back home or wherever them urgent private affairs are located and forget about that church roof
your half of the dog for that half a days work you still owe on them shingles
and the two dollars pap said
that you and tull agreed on
i sell you half the dog for two dollars and you comeback here tomorrow and finish the shingles
you give me the two dollars now and ill meet you here in the morning with the dog and you can show me the receipt from tull for his half then
me and tull have already agreed solon said
all right pap said
then you can pay tull his two dollars and bring his receipt with you without no trouble
tull will beat the church tomorrow morning pulling off the mold shingles solon said
all right pap said
then it wont be no trouble at all for you to get a receipt from him
you can stop at the church when you pass
tull a in t named gri er
he wont need to be off somewhere tomorrow morning borrowing a crowbar
so solon taken out his purse and paid pap the two dollars and they went back to work and now it looked like they really was trying to finish that afternoon not jest solon but even homer that didnt even seem to be concerned in it no how and pap that had already swapped a half a dog to get rid of whatever work solon claimed would be leftover
i quit trying to stay up with the mi jest stacked shingles
then solon laid his f roe and maul down
well men he said i dont know what you feller s think but i consider this a day
all right pap said
you are the one to decide when to quit since whatever elbow units you consider are going to be shy tomorrow will be your n
that s a fact solon said
and since iam giving a day and a half to the church instead of jest a day like i started outdoing i reckon i better get on home and tend to a little of my own work
he picked up his f roe and maul and a x and went to his truck and stood waiting for homer to come and get in
ill be here in the morning with the dog pap said
s holy solon said
it sounded like he had forgot about the dog or that it wasnt no longer any importance
but he stood there again and looked hard and quiet at pap for about a second
and a bill of sale from tull for his half of it
as you say it wont be no trouble at all to get that from him
him and homer got into the truck and he started the engine
you couldnt say jest what it was
it was almost like solon was hurrying himself so pap wouldnt have to make any excuse or pretense toward doing or not doing anything
i have always understood the fact that lightning dont have to hit twice is one of the reasons why they named it lightning
so getting lightning struck is a mistake that might happen to any man
the mistake i seem to made is in ever realized in time that what i was looking at was a cloud
ill see you in the morning
with the dog pap said
certainly solon said again like it had slipped his mind completely
with the dog
then him and homer drove off
then pap got up what
i said
what
you swapped him your half of tull s dog for that half a days work tomorrow
now what
yes pap said
only before that i had already swapped tull a half a days work pulling off the mold shingles tomorrow for tull s half of that dog
only we a in t got to wait until tomorrow
were going to pull them shingles off tonight and without no more racket about it than is necessary
i dont aim to have nothing on my mind tomorrow but watching mr solon work unit quick trying to get a bill of sale for two dollars or ten dollars either on the other half of that dog
and well do it tonight
i dont want him jest to find out at sunup tomorrow that he is too late
i want him to find out then that even when he had laid down to sleep he was already too late
so we went back home and if ed and milked while pap went down to kill e grew s to carry the f roe and maul back and to borrow a crowbar but of all places in the world and doing what under the sun with it oldman kill e grew had went and lost his crowbar out of a boat in forty feet of water
and pap said how he come within a inch of going to solon s and borrowing his crowbar out of pure poetic justice only solon might have smelled the rat jest from the idea of the crowbar
so pap went to arms tid s and borrowed his n and comeback and we et supper and cleaned and filled the lantern while maw still tried to find out what we was up to that couldnt wait till morning
we left her still talking even as far as the front gate and come on back to the church walking this time with the rope and crowbar and a hammer forme and the lantern still dark
whitfield and s nope s was unloading a ladder from s nope s wagon when we passed the church on the way home before dark so all we had to do was to set the ladder up against the church
the npa pcl umb upon to the roof with the lantern and pulled off shingles until he could hang the lantern inside behind the decking where it could shine out through the cracks in the planks but you couldnt see it unless you was passing in the road and by that time anybody would a already heard us
then icl umb up with the rope and pap reached it through the decking and around ar after and back and tied the ends around our waists and we started
and we went at it
we had the mold shingles jes training down me using the claw hammer and pap using the crowbar working the bar under a whole patch of shingles at one time and then laying back on the bar like in one more lick ori for if the crowbar ever happened for one second to get a solid hol the would tilt the whole roof up at one time like a hinged box lid that s exactly what he finally done he laid back on the bar and this time he it got a holt
it wasnt jest a patch of shingles it was a whole section of decking so that when he lunged back he snatched that whole section of roof from around the lantern like you would shuck acorn nub bin the lantern was hanging on a nail
he never even moved the nail he jest pulled the board off of it so that it looked like for a whole minute i watched the lantern and the crowbar too setting there in the empty air in a little mess of floating shingles with the empty nail still sticking through the bail of the lantern before the whole thing started down into the church
it hit the floor and bounced once
the nith it the floor again and this time the whole church jest blowed up into a pit of yellow jumping fire with me and pap hanging over the edge of it on two ropes
i dont know what become of the rope nor how we got out of it
i dont remember climbing down
jest pap yelling behind me and pushing me halfway down the ladder and then throwing me the rest of the way by a handful of my over halls and then we was both on the ground running for the water barrel
it set under the gutter spout at the side and arms tid was there then he had happened togo out to his lot about a hour back and seen the lantern on the church roof and it stayed on his mind until finally he come up to see what was going on and got there jest in time to stand yelling back and forthwith papa cross the water barrel
and i believe we still would have put it out
pap turned and squatted against the barrel and got a holt of it over his shoulder and stood up with that barrel that was almost full and runaround the corner and up the steps of the church and hooked his to eon the top step and comedown with the barrel busting on top of him and knocking him cold out as a wedge
so we had to drag him back first and maw was there then and mrs arms tid about the sametime and me and arms tid run with the two fire buckets to the spring and when we got back there was aplenty there whitfield too with more buckets and we done what we could but the spring was two hundred yards away and ten buckets emptied it and it taken five minutes to fill again so finally we all jest stood around where pap had come to again with a big cut on his head and watched it go
it was a old church long dried out and full of old colored picture charts that whitfield had accumulated for more than fifty years that the lantern had lit right in the middle of when it finally exploded
there was a special nail where he would keep a old long nightshirt he would wear to baptize in i used to watch it all the time during church and sunday school and me and the other boys would go past the church sometimes jest to peep in at it because to a boy often it wasnt jest a cloth garment or even a iron armor it was the old strong arch archangel michael his self that had fit and strove and conquered s in for so long that it finally had the same contempt for the human beings that returned always to s in as hogs and dogs done that the old strong archangel himself must have had
so for along time it never burned even after everything else inside had
we could watch it hanging there among the fire not like it had know ed in its time too much water to burn easy but like it had strove and fit with the devil and all the hosts of hell too long to burnin jest a fire like res gri er started trying to beat solon quick out of half a dog
but at last it went too not in a hurry still but jest all at once kind of roaring right upon and out against the stars and the far dark spaces
and then there wasnt nothing but jest pap drenched and groggy looking on the ground with the rest of us around him and whitfield like always in his boiled shirt and his black hat and pants standing there with his hat on too like he had strove too long to save what hadn tought to been created in the first place from the damnation it didnt even want to escape to bother to need to take his hat off in any presence
he looked around at us from under it we was all there now all that belonged to that church and used it to be born and marry and die from us and the arms tid s and tull s and book wrights and quick and s nope ses
i was wrong whitfield said
it old you we would meet here tomorrow toro of a church
well meet here in the morning to raise one
of course we got to have a church pap said
were going to have one
and were going to have it soon
but there s some of usd one already give a day or so this week at the cost of our own work
which is right and just and were going to give more and glad to
but i dont believe that the lord whitfield let him finish
he never moved
he jest stood there until pap finally rundown out of his own accord and hushed and set there on the ground mostly not looking at maw before whitfield opened his mouth
not you whitfield said
arsonist arsonist
pap said
yes whitfield said
if there is any pursuit in which you can engage without carrying flood and fire and destruction and death behind you do it
but not one hands hall you lay to this new house until you have proved to us that you are to be trusted again with the powers and capacities of a man
he looked about at us again
tull and s nope s and arms tid have already promised for tomorrow
i understand that quick had another half day he intended i can give another day solon said
i can give the rest of the week homer said
iain t rushed neither s nope s said
that will be enough to start with then whitfield said
its late now
let us all go home
he went first
he didnt look back once at the church or at us
he went to the old mare and clu mb up slow and stiff and powerful and was gone and we went too scattering
but i looked back at it
it was jest a shell now with a red and fading core and i had hated it at times and feared it at others and i should have been glad
but there was something that even that fire had nt even touched
maybe that s all it was jest in destruct i bil it yen durability that oldman that could plan to build it back while its walls was still fire fierce and then calmly turn his back and go away because he know ed that the men that had never had nothing to give toward the new one but their work would be there at sunup tomorrow and the day after that and the day after that too as long as it was needed to give that work to build it back again
so it had nt gone at all it didnt no more care for that little fire and flood than whitfield sold baptizing gown had done
then we was home
maw had left so fast the lamp was still lit and we could see pap now still leaving a puddle where he stood with a cut across the back of his head where the barrel had busted and the blood streaked water soaking him to the waist
get them wet clothes off maw said
i dont know as i will or not pap said
i been publicly notified that iain t fit ten to associate with white folks so i publicly notify them same white folks and methodists too not to try to associate with me or the devil can have the hindmost
but maw had nt even listened
when she comeback with a pan of water and a towel and the liniment bottle pap was already in his nightshirt
i dont want none of that neither he said
if my head wasnt worth busting it a in t worth patching
but she never paid no mind to that neither
she washed his head off and dried it and put the bandage on and went out again and pap went and got into bed
hand me my snuff then you get out of here and stay out too he said
but before i could do that maw comeback
she had a glass of hot toddy and she went to the bed and stood there with it and pap turned his head and looked at it
what s that
he said but maw never answered and then he setup in bed and draw ed along shuddering breath we could hear it and after a minute he put out his hand for the toddy and set there holding it and drawing his breath and then he taken as ip of it
i godfrey if him and all of them put together think they can keep me from working on my own church like ary other man he better be a goodman to try it
he taken another sip of the toddy
then he taken along one
arsonist he said
work units
dog units
and now arsonist
i godfrey what a day
audience laughter and applause why do you choose to so often have your characters dressed in the vestments of of the christian myth making at times christ like people like popeye or joe christmas or even ben jy making them at other times madonna like such as the woman in sanctuary and at other times judas like such as lucas b urchin light in august
i think a writer has to write out of his experience his background he also has a sort of lumber room like the carpenter has a lumber room a room full of scraps of boards of this and that and when he finds that he needs something to tell the story he s trying to tell he looks around in the lumber room and he finds aboard that he can use and since my past is a or my background is a christian background my education is the normal education full of the christian symbols i use them as the carpenter uses the boards that fit the job
im not trying to write about symbols at all
im writing about people but i use these symbols simply because they re shortcuts to help me tell the story im trying to tell
sir why do you sometimes satirize the south and at other times very very strenuously satirize it what is your general feeling of the south and the deep south
its my country my native land and i love it
im not trying to satirize it
i mim trying that is im not expressing my own ideas in the stories i tell
im telling about people and these people express ideas which which sometimes are mine sometimes are not mine but i myself am not trying to satirize my country
i love it and it has its faults and i will try to correct the mbuti wouldnt try to correct them when im writing a story because im telling talking about people then
when you draw your characters they re probably composites i imagine of people that you have met and known but is there any special character or characters you draw on more than others from real life
no its the writer has three sources observation imagination and experience and doubt i probably even he cant say at one time just how much of each one he has used
he is too busy trying to make a human being that is alive that will stand up and casta shadow behind him and he is the writer is completely amoral and he will take what he needs where he finds it because he is perfectly willing for anyone to take from him what they find in what he has done that they can use
what would you say would be the relation in this rather charming story you just read to the what kind of lumber did you take from fact to build this story
what would you know of and see and hear and how did you shape it to make it different from what you might have known in life
well these people that i know they are my people and i love them they might well have done this
i just got to it before they did
mr faulkner i want to ask you an entirely different question
ive brought some students who are creative writing students an did like to ask if you have some suggestions different suggestions that you think a beginning writer should have a young writer should have
the first thing to doi think is to read to read and to read and to read
as i say the the writer has got to have a lumber room like the carpenter and the best lumber room he can have is the the good bookstore ad and to read and to read
the the next thing is to watch people to try to understand why people do what they do whether the motives are good motives or base motives to understand to not judge their motives just to understand them and then to work
i think if the young writer can can follow those three rules he can make his own rules that suit his particular case as he goes along but they are good general rules i think for a young writer to follow sir you said he has to read the good books
what were the good books that you read
by the good books i mean the books that have people still read a hundred and two and three hundred years afterwards and they would be what we call the classics
there are good books printed today but i meant only books that people have still read enough so that they are still remembered and still known
it doesnt mean the books themselves are good
it means that they were good enough that people still like to read them and since they have continued to read them for these one hundred or two or three hundred years they ll probably continue for another three or four hundred years
sir must a writer always be objective or must he get in and actually sort of live what he is writing about in other words make it apart of the an integral part of his life
to be completely objective you ll become a reporter
i used to think that it took talent to be a writer but now i think it takes mostly insight that means to to wonder to speculate always why people do what they do and you ve got to get inside people
you ve got to love people at the sametime that you hate people to do that
you cant be on the outside
then you re just a reporter
you ve got to be in the middle of life to write about it and that s what you rewriting about you know is life is motion
can a writer can he write without ever passing judgment on his characters
i well he i doubt if you can know anybody an imaginary character or or living person without passing judgment on them
that s that s a little too godlike
you ve got to pass judgment you ve got to love you ve got to hate even the character that you have created yourself
what is your objective in using long sentences over short sentences
do you think is that a stream of consciousness effect or do you feel you can convey your thoughts easier by them
that is a matter of the carpenter trying to find the hammer or the axe that he thinks will will do the best job
another thing is everyone has a foreknowledge of death
that is he will have only a very short time comparatively to do the work and he is trying to put the whole history of the human heart on the head of a pin you might say
also to men oman is himself
he is the sum of his past
there s no such thing really as was because the past is
it is apart of of of everyman every woman at every moment
all of his and her ancestry background is all apart of him of himself and herself at any moment
and so a man a character in a story at any moment of action is not just himself as he is then
he is all that made him and the long sentence is an attempt to get his past and possibly his future into the instant in which he does something
but tom ewha the does is not quite as important as who he is the fact that he is a continuity that he has come along way that he has endured and he is i hope we hope better than than his ancestors were that he s more compassionate
he s more tolerant
we hope braver more honest
a few weeks ago the richmond papers quoted you as having organized in ascending order of excellence american writers you admire
would you be willing to suggest what the criterion was
the criterion was failure
my feeling is that we all fail that none of it is as good as we all wanted it to be
none of my stuff is as good as i wanted it to be
that s why i keep on writing another one and so i rated these people only by what i called the splendor of the failure
the one that made the most magnificent failure i rated first not by the value that they did but by the splendor of the failure the ambition the aspiration to do more than than maybe a human being can do because you dont want to be better than than your your fellow writer
you want to be as good as anybody that ever did write
you want to be as good as dante and homer and shakespeare and you cant you fail so you write another book
if you ever did that one time then the red be nothing left for you to do
you d have to pickup take up a new trade im sorry
well this is more or less a question of fact
in the sound and the fury was jason comp son did you was he a bastard
nono not a not an actual one only but in behavior
do you find that its easier to write this this wonderful rolling rhetoric of yours than it is to write a completely objective scene
forme it is
im too busy trying to make my people come to life and then i run behind them at full speed trying to keep up with the mandi put down the best i can
i dont have time to think about style
i believe that anyone who spends too much time on style has nt got a great deal to say
that if you have a lot to say you dont have time to think of style
you wish you could think of style and and think of the material too but i dont believe that anyone can mr
faulkner o him sorry
in connection with that do you revise much
i revise a great deal
im lazy i dont like the mechanics of of getting the words on to the paper
i will put that off as long as possible so a lot of the revision is done here
until i cant put off writing anymore then i begin to put it down and if its not right then i rewrite and i rewrite and i rewrite until its the best i can do but i wont rewrite if i can help it
i like to get it all done so the first one is will do because im lazy
yes m
what do you consider your own most splendid failure if you could tellus
the sound and the fury because i worked at it the longest and the hardest
in that connection did you write it in the order in which it was published
yes it was written in that order
yes
i wrote the ben jy part first
that wasnt good enough so i wrote the quentin part
that still wasnt good enough
i let jason try it
that still wasnt enough
i let faulkner try it and that still wasnt enough and so about twenty years afterwards i wrote an appendix still trying to make that book what match the dream
i once read an article in which the writer speaking of the end of the sound and the fury said that the whole pattern of the book does not become apparent until the very end in the incident in which ben jy begins to cry and blubber when they go left around the monument and must turn to the right
now while i think that simply confirms everything that has gone before did you intend that as the moment of revelation
no siri did not
i was still a sive just said i was still trying to tell that story
in the first section i had nt told it
i had to try again
i had to try three four time sive always been afraid it was something i missed in the ending
im glad to have you confirm that
thankyou mr
faulkner you say you write because you have a story to tell and you try to tell it in the best way
how do you conceive these stories
which comes first
its the people
suddenly people are doing something that is tragic or funny or something brave of of sacrifice that seems tome moving enough to be worth telling and then after that its a matter of of invention to tell the story well how do you get the basic idea
i mean i dont know where it comes from
are you conscious of anyway or theme any attempt that you have more frequently something that turned out to be a dead end or a blind alley and then did you put that in terms some other way
yes sir that s a matter of of so much as much of that as possible is done up here
i have written three manuscripts that never did quite please mean di burned them up
but its you try and you try and you try to do the best you can to make something which which to you was passionate and moving so passionate and moving that it wouldnt let you alone
you had to write it and then you you do the best you can to make it as passionate and moving to anyone who reads it as it was to you because it seems worthwhile worth doing why do you suppose that it didnt workout in those three books
it could be that i didnt know enough
it could be that the people were not good enough people
that they they never did they never the books the manuscripts were never good enough forme to pass them so i just put them in the fire and got rid of them
you once disinherited sanctuary in the preface i think to the modern library edition by saying it was a book written strictly for money and that you hoped to make it as sensational as possible if this is so sir why did you write a sequel to it in requiem for a nun
well i wrote that book to make a little money
i sent it to the publisher and he said good lord we all well both be in jail if we print this so i forgot about it
i wrote two more books
they were printed
and the none day i got the galleys for sanctuary and i read them and it was so bad so basely conceived that i wrote the publisher to lets destroy it and he said i have had the plates made
i have invested money in it
at that time he didnt have a great deal of money either and i said well its i cant pass it like this so ill rewrite it
and he said all right but you rewrite it then and and ill pay half the new plates and you pay half the new plates so i said all right
so i rewrote the book and made the best i could out of out of the first base story and that cost me my share of the plates was two hundred and seventy dollars at a time when i didnt have two hundred and seventy dollars
i got a job passing coal at a powerplant to earn my share
the books old
the first money i was to have sixty five hundred dollars and the publisher went broke and i didnt get that which served me exactly right
yes sir sir do you think that man is getting better and better everyday in every way
i think that i think that man tries to be better than he think she will be
i think that that is his immortality that he wants to be better he wants to be braver he wants to be more honest than he think she will be and sometimes he s not but then suddenly to his own astonishment he is
yes ma amin reference to sanctuary when you were writing this did you have in mind anything like the rape of the south i mean there s been a lot of talk about that
did you have that in mind when you wrote no either time
no
i was simply writing a story which i thought somebody might pay some money for the first instance
yes and the second time i was trying to make the best i could out of something that was going to cost me two hundred and seventy dollars
when you wrote the fable and moved over into a different background what did you have in mind as a bigger success than you had had before in your mississippi background
that was the only book i ever wrote from an idea and the idea struck me who might the soldier really be under the splendid cenotaph with the eternal fire burning over it
suppose that had been christ
suppose he had comeback and had been crucified for the second time
we might not have but one more chance that came from an idea
that was the only book that was ever written from a simple idea
the others have come from my own people
yes sir young gerald here was struck by what you said about good people and wants me to ask you what you mean by good people
i mean that people want to be better than they are
i believe that all people want to be better than they are want to be more honest and more compassionate
i think that s the only reason the human race has has lasted as long as it has because it does want to be better than it is that individual people want to be better than they are afraid they are and they do try and they fail but then suddenly when nobody expects it they are better then may i ask if all of these characters in the sound and the fury that you would call them good people
i would call them tragic people
the the good people dil sey the negro woman she was a good human being
that she held that family together for not the hope of reward but just because it was the decent and proper thing to do jason was bad wasn the
jason was bad yes
quentin was weak
jason was yes was bad
do you think people are good because they want to be better or because
well that can it can be any number of personal reasons why the individual wants to be better but i think that in in general man wants to be better than he is that he doesnt want to be cruel that he would like to get rid of of grief if he just knew how to if he was just wise enough
he would like to get rid of war for instance if he just knew how or just wise enough to get rid of greed if he just knew how do you think that the amount
im sorry
i couldnt hear do you think that the amount of that each person has determines his ability for goodness
determines his behavior yes
not his goodness but his behavior
his goodness is i like to believe is a constant factor but he cant always match it but he wants to be better than he is than he s afraid he might be and he tries sir you indicated before that a fable was a departure in that insofar that it was the only book written from an absolute idea with with regular city limits to it
but i find atleast i find that the basic crucifixion image in a fable occurs over and over again in your books
it occurs in light in august
it happens in a kind of way even in in sanctuary
it happens in requiem for an uncertainly with with nancy
isnt a fable simply a more positive way of approaching the problem
as a result it might be
remember the writer must write out of his background
he must write out of what he knows and the christian legend is apart of of any christians background especially the background of a of a of a country boy a southern country boy
my life was passed my childhood in a very small mississippi town and that was apart of my background
i grew up with that
i assimilated that took that in without even knowing it
its just just there
it has nothing to do with how much of it i might believe or disbelieve
its just there
when you have time to this story did it become more more real to you than the other things you do
let me understand you
the story that i think of is more real than the actual writing when you rewriting the story does it does this come a lot closer to being reality than the things you do like eating breakfast or walking down the street
at the moment im completely demon ridden to get that story written that nothing else matters
its not that the world is not there anymore
its just that im too busy getting getting my story done to pay much attention to the to the actual world but its still there and igo back to it
conrad aiken once said that after he had written a story the story then seemed perhaps more real than the things which had happened and that as he thought back on i the felt that the thing that he had written was what had happened in his life as it had as opposed to the actual fact
do you find that so or not
noi dont
that s mr aiken s own point of view
that s not mine too much
that my my people are are are no more real than the actual world but no less real
that is they have their place in in life to otome
yes sir is it possible that you project on to your characters a greater sophistication than they have as i know that type of person it seems tome that they re not quite as sophisticated as for example the christian myth as they understand it doesnt seem tome to be quite yours
the writer is not a reporter
he is using his imagination his observation his experience and of course his own warped ideas without not deliberately but he can the lp it
its apart of his background apart of his workshop and possibly they are more sophisticated than as i write them than they areas they live in in the world
im still trying to tell a story
i use the material which seems tome to tell the story best and its not any deliberate intent to make these people more sophisticated than they are
it seems tome seems that is the best way to tell the story im trying to tell
back to talking about this matter of the good people you said that man wants to be better than he is and be more honest and be more compassionate
does this in these terms do you also mean to love more here or is this just another
yes yes you could put it that way and man in trying to be better than he is in this way do you feel that he can pretty much do this on his own
in other words not always
sometimes he needs help
not always can here lyon a power outside beyond himself
sometimes yes but the will to be better than he is is in himself
he may not be able to do it without help from outside or from a greater power than he but the desire to be better than he is afraid he might be is inside him inside his conscience unless he is an idiot of course
yes sir
you the book of yours which troubles me most is puzzles me most doesnt trouble meat all is as i lay dying
somebody once suggested tome that the i think there s thirteen characters in it constitute really the separate parts of just one man
is this so
no they were i was i was writing about people again i took these people and that s a simple tour de force
i took this family and subjected them to the two greatest catastrophes which which man can suffer flood and fire
that s all
that was simple tour de force
that was written in six weeks without changing a word because i knew from the first where that was going
in a fable and in some other places you used the term prevail as over against the word endure
could you spell out forme what sort of ultimate victory you envisioned for the use of that term prevail
i believe that in time man will will get rid of war just as he has got rid of of other evils
little children dont have to work any longer
a man can no longer have his hand chopped off for stealing a loaf of bread that a lot has been done to get rid of poverty and hunger and misery and in that way man prevails
i how far he can go before through some of his own fault he eradicates himself from the face of the earth i dont know but he tries to improve his condition and does
yes sir
in reference to the sound and the fury again is the tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing applicable to ben jy as its generally thought or perhaps to jason
the title of course came from the first section which was ben jy
i thought that the story was told in ben jy s section and the title came there
so it in that sense it does apply to ben jy rather than to anybody else i see
though the more i had to work on the book the more elastic the title became until it covers the whole family the most sound and the fury seems to fallin jason s section in my opinion
yes thankyou
in the town there are references to episodes for about half a dozen of your early novels with to comment on them
do they appear there simply because they mobbed in belonging to your background or were you consciously trying to tie together and to give more coherence to the town
the town is the second of a trilogy
the first one was called the hamlet
these references are to things in the hamlet but there there are references to other books than the hamlet that i found including perhaps its simply the fact that you used some of the same characters from from the earlier books
that could be it yes
i used the characters which are my people tome are are quite alive and they move back and forth through these different books and i myself no longer remember just where what character appeared
i remember that character but i dont always remember what he did
i would like to ask if your people are derived principally from an area or region of mississippi and if you think that was away of life there that has more to offer than say if a writer perhaps to the idea is that your surroundings as well as your own education and your own
i dont think people are that different
i think there is not a great deal of difference between southerners and northerners and americans and russians and chinese
that im simply using the background the color the smells the sounds that iam familiar with but the people in my opinion are not that different
they could be anywhere
of course they would wear different clothes and their behavior might be a little awry from what it is in north mississippi but the behavior would be the same
they would have the same anguishes the same hopes and they russians or chinese would still want to be better than they are afraid they might be and they would both try to be better
you talk about your so many of the things you write about come from your background
a good part of my family is from clarksdale mississippi and mississippian s are proud of you but you ve shocked a great many of usi wonder do you think that stems from a reluctance on their part to see some of the people you write about in their midst
well i dont know
there are not too many mississippian s read very much and they re probably and they spend as much time as ido just writing
im sorry that ii shock my people of my own country but im simply trying to tell about people which i think are are astounding and marvelous creatures well worth writing about in the terms which seem tome the best to make the story vivid and memorable
what is the meaning of the title arose for emily
oh its simply the poor woman had had no life at all
her father had kept her more or less locked up and then she had a lover and he was about to quit her
she had to murder him
it was just arose for emily that s all
does your criterion apply to say the great writers of the past
nom the criterion for judging the writing of the past is the ones that i like to read that i will read again and again and again
i dont know of any writer of the present who whose work i will read again and again and again as i will read cervantes for instance or dickens
dont you believe that in a few hundred years say that there will be books produced that were produced in this century that will be read over and over again as dickens is read today
now that i cant say for the reason that the writer is really too busy with his own work to have much time to read what anybody else does so i just dont know really what people are writing today
i dodo know that what i write a in t as good as i want it to be and so im going to keep on trying to write one that will suit me
i probably wont but i intend to keep on trying
ive read and also ive heard the poet john nei hard t say that you have to make yourself s it there and write something everyday that that s the way to do it whether its or not how much is inspiration and how much is perspiration
i that system works with lots of people but not with me
in ever had any trouble writing the stuff
its persuading myself to s it down and do it some people that sort of discipline works with but but with others it it dont
with me it never would that i put off writing as long as possible and then when i get started i can write for tenor twelve hours day after day until i get until i get strictly as a matter of your choice of forms do you ever find yourself beginning a short story that suddenly blossoms or has to blossom into a novel or viceversa
yes sir or can you cite from the novels that the sound and the fury started as a short story i thought it could be done in ten pages
then i had written a hundred pages and that wasnt enough
i wrote another hundred
that wasnt enough
another hundred
that still wasnt enough
yes sir sir a great many of the people that tennessee williams writes about are southerners
what is your opinion of these people that he writes about
well the i couldnt have any opinion of the people that he writes about
i could have an opinion of the of the complete job that s done
the best of of williams tome was a play called camino real
i think caton a hot tin roof was written about the wrong people
the story was the oldman s story
i think that the anguishes of children a in t worth three acts
i know we all feel greatly indebted to the university of virginia for making it possible for mr faulkner to be here
were indebted to dr simpson who made his introduction to the university
and of course most of all were indebted to mr faulkner himself for being willing to come along
im going to ask professor gwynn of the university s department of english to introduce mr
faulkner
ive already found out that the only way to hold an audience is to be a little higher than it is and for a short man like me its impossible to do it unless you are higher so if its all right im going to stand up
pap got up a good hour before daylight and caught the mule and rid down to kill e grew s to borrow the f roe and maul
he ought to been back with it in forty minutes
but the sun had rose and i had done milked and fed and was eating my breakfast when he got back with the mule not only in a lather but right on the edge of the thumps too
fox hunting he said
fox hunting
a seventy year oldman with both feet and one knee too already in the grave squatting all night on a hill and calling his self listening to a fox race that he couldnt even hear unless they had come upon to the same log he was setting on and bayed into his ear trumpet
give me my breakfast he told maw
whitfield is standing there right this minute straddle of that board tree with his watch in his hand
and he was
we rid on past the church and there was not only solon quick s school bus truck but reverend whitfield sold mare too
we tied the mule to a sapling and hung our dinner bucket on a limb and with pap toting kill e grew sf roe and maul and the wedges and me toting our a x we went on to the board tree where solon and homer book wright with their f roes and mauls and axes and wedges was setting on two upended cuts and whitfield was standing jest like pap said in his boiled shirt and his black hat and pants and necktie holding his watch in his hand
it was gold and in the morning sunlight it looked big as a full grow ed squash
you relate he said so pap told him again about how oldman kill e grew had been off fox hunting all night and nobody at home to lend him the f roe but mr skille grew and the cook
and naturally the cook wasnt going to lend none of kill e grew stools out and mr skille grew was worse r than deaf than even kill e grew
if you was to run in and tell her the house was a fire she would jest keep on rocking and says he thought so too unless she began to holler back to the cook to turn the dogs loose before you could even open your mouth
you could have gone yesterday and borrowed the f roe whitfield said
you have known for a month now that you had promised this one day out of a whole summer toward putting a roof on the house of god
we a in t but two hours late pap said
i reckon the lord will forgive it
he a in t interested in time no how
he s interested in salvation
whitfield never even waited for pap to finish
it looked tome like he even got taller thundering down at pap like a cloudburst
he a in t interested in neither
why should he be when he owns them both
and why he should turnaround for the poor m izz ling souls of men that cant even borrow tools in time to replace the shingles on his church i dont know either
maybe its just because he made them
maybe he just said to himself i made the mi dont know why
but since i didi godfrey ill roll my sleeves up and drag them into glory whether they will or no
but that wasn there nor there neither now and i reckon he know edit jest like he know ed there wasnt going to be nothing at all here as long as he stayed
so he put the watch back into his pocket and motioned solon and homer up and we all taken of four hats except him while he stood there with his face raised into the sun and his eyes shut and his eyebrows looking like a big iron gray caterpillar laid along the edge of a cliff
lord he said make them good straight shingles to lay smooth and let them split out easy they re for you and opened his eyes and looked at us again mostly at pap and went and untied his mare and clu mb up slow and stiff like old men do and rid away
pap put down the f roe and maul and laid the three wedges in an eat row on the ground and taken up the a x
well men he said lets get started
were already late
me and home rain t solon said
we was here
this time him and homer didnt seton the cuts
they squatted on their heels
then i seen that homer was whittling on a stick
i had nt noticed it before
i make it two hours and a little over solon said
more or less
pap was still about half stooped over holding the a x
its nigher one he said
but call it two for the sake of the argument
what about it
what argument
homer said
all right pap said
two hours then
what about it
which is three man hour units a hour multiplied by two hours solon said
or a total of six work units
when the wp and a first come toyo k napa taw pha county and started to giving out jobs and grub and mattresses solon went into jefferson to get on it
he would drive his school bus truck the twenty two miles into town every morning and comeback that night hedone that for almost a week before he found out he would not only have to sign his farm off into somebody else s name he couldnt even own and run the school bus that he had built himself
so he comeback that night and never went back no more and since then had nt nobody better mention wp and a to him unless they aimed to fight too though every now and then he would turn up with something all figured down into work units like hedone now
six units short
four of which you and homer could have already worked out while you was setting here waiting on me pap said
except that we didnt solon said
we promised whitfield two units of twelve three unit hours toward getting some new shingles on the church roof
we been here ever since sunup waiting for the third unit to show up so we could get started
you dont seem to kept up with these modern ideas about work that s been flooding and uplifting the country in the last few years
what mod ren ideas
pap said
i didnt know there was but one idea about work until it is done it a in td one and when it is done it is
i see pap said
i see
its me that s got to comeback
by myself
i got to break into a full morning to makeup them two hours that you and homer spent resting
i got to spend two hours of the next day making up for the two hours of the day before that you and homer never even worked
maybe there s something else besides cash you might be able to trade with though solon said
you might use that dog
that was when pap actually stopped
i didnt know it myself the neither but i found it out a good longtime before solon did
pap set there with the maul up over his head and the blade of the froese t against the block for the next lick looking at solon
the dog
he said it was a kind of mixed hound with a little bird dog and some collie and maybe a considerable of almost anything else but it would ease through the woods without no more noise than ahan t and pickup a squirrels trail on the ground and bark jest once unless it know ed you was where you couldnt see it and then tiptoe that trail out jest like a man and never make another sound until it treed and only then when it know ed you had nt kept insight of it
it belonged to pap and vernon tull together will var ner give it to tull as a puppy and pa praised it for a half interest me and him trained it and it slept in my bed with me until it got sobig maw finally run it out of the house and for the last six months solon had been trying to buy it
him and tull had agreed on two dollars for tull s half of it but solon and pap was still six dollars apart on our n because pap said it was worth ten dollars of anybody s money and if tull wasnt going to collect his full half of that he was going to collect it for him
so that s it pap said
them things wasnt work units at all
they was dog units
your half of the dog for that half a days work you still owe on them shingles
and the two dollars pap said
that you and tull agreed on
i sell you half the dog for two dollars and you comeback here tomorrow and finish the shingles
you give me the two dollars now and ill meet you here in the morning with the dog and you can show me the receipt from tull for his half then
me and tull have done already agreed solon said
all right pap said
then you can pay tull his two dollars and bring his receipt with you without no trouble
tull will beat the church tomorrow morning pulling off the mold shingles solon said
all right pap said
then it wont be no trouble at all for you to get a receipt from him
you can stop at the church when you pass
tull a in t named gri er
he wont need to be off somewhere tomorrow borrowing a crowbar
so solon taken out his purse and paid pap the two dollars and they went back to work
and now it looked like they was really trying to finish that afternoon not jest solon but even homer that didnt seem to be concerned in it no how and pap that had already swapped a half a dog to get rid of whatever work solon claimed would be leftover
i quit trying to stay up with them then i jest stacked shingles
then solon laid his f roe and maul down
well men he said i dont know what you feller s think but i consider this a day
all right pap said
you are the one to decide when to quit since whatever elbow units you consider are going to be shy tomorrow will be your n
that s a fact solon said
and since iam giving a day and a half to the church instead of jest a day like i started outdoing i reckon i better get on home and tend to a little of my own work
he picked up his f roe and maul and a x and went on to his truck and stood waiting for homer to come and get in
ill be here in the morning with the dog pap said
s holy solon said
it sounded like he had forgot about the dog or that it wasnt no longer any importance
but he stood there again and looked hard and quiet at pap for about a second
and a bill of sale from tull for his half of it
as you say it wont be no trouble at all to get that from him
him and homer got into the truck and he started the engine
you couldnt say jest what it was
it was almost like solon was hurrying himself so pap wouldnt have to make any excuse or pretense toward doing or not doing anything
i have always understood the fact that lightning dont have to hit twice is one of the reasons why they named it lightning
so getting lightning struck is a mistake that might happen to any man
the mistake i seem to have made is in ever realized in time that what i was looking at was a cloud
ill see you in the morning
with the dog pap said
certainly solon said again like it had slipped his mind completely
with the dog
then him and homer drove off
then pap got up what
i said
what
you swapped him your half of tull s dog for that half a days work tomorrow
now what
yes pap yes pap said
only before that i had already swapped tull a half a days work pulling off the mold shingles tomorrow for tull s half of that dog only we a in t going to wait until tomorrow
were going to pull them shingles off tonight and without no more racket about it than is necessary
i dont aim to have nothing on my mind tomorrow but watching mr solon work unit quick trying to get a bill of sale for two dollars or ten dollars either on on the other half of that dog
and well do it tonight
i dont want him jest to find out at sunup tomorrow that he is too late
i want him to find out then that even when he laid down to sleep he was already too late
so we went back home and if ed and milked while pap went down to kill e grew s to carry the f roe and maul back and to borrow a crowbar
but of all places in the world and doing what under the sun with it oldman kill e grew had went and lost his crowbar out of a boat into forty feet of water
and pap said how he come within a inch of going to solon s and borrowing his crowbar out of pure poetic justice only solon might have smelled the rat jest from the idea of the crowbar
so pap went to arms tid s and borrowed his n and comeback and we et supper and cleaned and filled the lantern while maw still tried to find out what we was up to that couldnt wait till morning
we left her still talking even as far as the front gate and come on back to the church walking this time with the rope and crowbar and a hammer forme and the lantern still dark
whitfield and s nope s was unloading a ladder from s nope s wagon when we passed the church on the way home before dark so all we had to do was to set the ladder up against the church
the npa pcl umb upon to the roof with the lantern and pulled off shingles until he could hang the lantern inside behind the decking where it could shine out through the cracks in the planks but you couldnt see it unless you was passing in the road and by that time anybody would a already heard us
then icl umb up with the rope and pap reached it through the decking and around ar after and back and tied the ends around our waists and we started
and we went at it
we had the mold shingles jes training down me using the claw hammer and pap using the crowbar working the bar under a whole patch of shingles at one time and then laying back on the bar like in one more lick or if the crowbar ever happened for one second to get a solid hol the would tilt that whole roof up at one time like a hinged box lid that s exactly what he finally done he laid back on the bar and this time it got a holt
it wasnt jest a patch of shingles it was a whole section of decking so that when he lunged back he snatched that whole section of roof from around the lantern like you would shuck acorn nub bin
the lantern was hanging on a nail
he never even moved the nail he jest pulled the board off of it so that it looked like for a whole minute i watched the lantern and the crowbar too setting there in the empty air in a little mess of floating shingles with the empty nail still sticking through the bail of the lantern before the whole thing started down into the church
it hit the floor and bounced once
the nith it the floor again and this time the whole church jest blowed up into a pit of yellow jumping fire with me and pap hanging over the edge of it on two ropes
i dont know what become of the rope nor how we got out of it
i dont remember climbing down
jest pap yelling behind me and pushing me halfway down the ladder and then throwing me the rest of the way by a handful of my over halls and then we was both on the ground running for the water barrel
it set under the gutter spout at the side and arms tid was there then he had happened togo out to his lot about a hour back and seen the lantern on the church roof and it stayed on his mind until finally he come up to see what was going on and got there jest in time to stand yelling back and forthwith papa cross the water barrel
and i believe we still would have put it out pap turned and squatted against the barrel and got a holt of it over his shoulder and stood up with that barrel that was almost full of water and runaround the corner and up the steps of the church and hooked his to eon the top step and comedown with the barrel busting on top of him and knocking him cold out as a wedge
so we had to drag him back first and maw was there then and mrs arms tid about the sametime and me and arms tid run with the two fire buckets to the spring and when we got back there was aplenty of them whitfield too with more buckets and we done what we could but the spring was two hundred yards away and ten buckets emptied it and it taken five minutes to fill again and so we finally all jest stood around where pap where had come to again with a big cut on his head and watched it go
it was a old church long dried out and full of old colored picture charts that whitfield had accumulated for more than fifty years that the lantern had lit right in the middle of when it finally exploded
there was a special nail where he would keep a old long nightshirt he would wear to baptize in
i would use to watch it all the time during church and sunday school and me and the other boys would go past the church sometimes jest to peep in at it because to a boy often it wasnt jest a cloth garment or even a iron armor it was the old strong archangel michael himself that had fit and strove and conquered s in for so long that it finally had the same contempt for the human beings that returned always to s in as hogs and dogs done that the old strong archangel his self must have had
for along time it never burned even after everything else inside had
we could watch it hanging there among the fire not like it had know edits time in its time too much water to burn easy but like it had strove and fit with the devil and all the hosts of hell too long to burnin jest a fire that res gri er started trying to beat solon quick out of half a dog
but at last it went too not in a hurry still but jest all at once kind of roaring right on up and out against the stars and the far dark spaces
and then there wasnt nothing but jest pap drenched and groggy looking on the ground with the rest of us around him and whitfield like always in his boiled shirt and his black hat and pants standing there with his hat on too like he had strove too long to save what hadn tought to been created in the first place from the damnation it didnt even want to escape to bother to need to take his hat off in any presence
he looked around at us from under it we was all there now all that belonged to that church and used it to be born and marry and die from us and the arms tid s and tull s and book wrights and quicksands nope s
i was wrong whitfield said
it old you we would meet here tomorrow toro of a church
well meet here in the morning to raise one
of course we got to have a church pap said
were going to have one
and were going to have it soon
but there s some of usd one already give a day or so this week at the cost of our own work which is right and just and were going to give more and glad to
but i dont believe that the lord whitfield let him finish
he never moved
he jest stood there until pap finally rundown of his own accord and hushed and set there on the ground mostly not looking at maw before whitfield opened his mouth
not you whitfield said
arsonist arsonist
pap said
if there is any pursuit in which you can engage without carrying flood and fire and destruction and death behind you do it
but not one hands hall you lay to this new house until you have proved to us that you are to be trusted again with the powers and capacities of a man
he looked about at us again
tull and s nope s and arms tid have already promised for tomorrow
i understand that quick had another half day he intended i can give another day solon said
i can give the rest of the week homer said
iain t rushed neither s nope s said
that will be enough to start with then whitfield said
its late now
let us all go home
he went first
he didnt look back once at the church or at us
he went to the old mare and clu mb up slow and stiff and powerful and was gone and we went too scattering
but i looked back at it
it was jest a shell now with a red and fading core and i had hated it at times and feared it at others and i would have been glad i should have been glad but there was something that even that fire had nt even touched
maybe that s all it was jest in destruct i bil it yen durability that oldman that could plan to build it back while its walls was still fire fierce and then calmly turn his back and go away because he know ed that the men that never had nothing to give toward the new one but their work would be there at sunup tomorrow and the day after that and the day after that too as long as it was needed to give that work to build it back again
so it had nt gone at all it didnt no more care for that little fire and flood than whitfield sold baptizing gown had done
then we was home
maw had left so fast the lamp was still lit and we could see pap now still leaving a puddle where he stood with a cut across the back of his head where the barrel had busted and blood streaked water soaking soaking him to the waist
get them wet clothes off maw said
i dont know as i will or not pap said
i been publicly notified that iain t fit ten to associate with white folks so i publicly notify them same white folks and methodists too not to try to associate with me or the devil can have the hindmost
but before i could do that maw comeback
she had a glass of hot toddy and she went to the bed and stood there with it and pap turned his head and looked at it
what s that
he said but maw never answered and then he setup in bed and draw ed along shuddering breath we could hear it and after a minute he put his handout for the toddy and set there holding it and drawing his breath and then he took as ip of it
i godfrey if him and all of them put together think they can keep me from working on my own church like ary other man he better be a goodman to try it
he taken taken another sip of the toddy
then he taken along one
arsonist he said
work units
dog units
and now arsonist
i godfrey what a day
audience laughter and applause do we want to ask mr faulkner anything
and let them be anything
i think if you try to rehearse the question first its its not too good
whether it seems frivolous to you or not ask it
well take the gloves off
would you discuss the religious symbolism in the sound and the fury
that was not accidental but coincidental
the writer has a mass of of lumber just as the carpenter has from experience observation
he is writing about people and he reaches back into his experience his observations his memory to get what he thinks will be the most effective way to tell about the people he stalking about and so i was not writing religious symbolism
i simply used that because it made i thought my story better
can you discuss the most important problem that you think faces the young american writer today
yes the most important problem is the pressure to relinquish individuality and belong to something to become a member of a mass
that s what the young writer has got to struggle against because any art is composed created incomplete solitude and the manor the woman has got to be primarily himself
he s got to believe in in men and women as individual men and women not just as a mass of people and so the first problem of the young writer is the time he lives in the pressure to belong to something to be a member of a mass of something and not himself
that s what the young writer
id like to know if james joyce had any influence in your work at all and to what extent
yes a great deal
its difficult for anyone to say because i think a writer is influenced by everything he ever reads from the telephone directory up and down and when i was young i read voraciously with no judgment no discretion and no taste
i read everything and anything and im quite sure it has all influenced me but the writer i think is probably too busy to say now lets see ill write a little joyce today or a little proust in the morning
he s influenced by it but he he doesnt knowhow much because he s too busy
that s part of the of the lumber in his storehouse that the carpenter uses when he s building his house or fence
every once in a while an author reports that what he intended as a short story got out of hand and turned into a novel
have you ever had this experience and if so what novel was the result of it
the sound and the fury began as a short story
i think my own rating is first is the poet
next is the short story writer
third is the novelist
the poet can say it in in fourteen lines or maybe four
the short story writer has got to have a thousand or two thousand words to say it
the novelist has got to have up to a hundred thousand and i think that what any writer would would want to be is a poet
i think of myself as a failed poet that i couldnt be a poet and and had sense enough to stop trying and to use a method which i could use and so any story starts out as well a good poet could put it in a poem a good short story writer could put it in a short story but the novelist it takeshima thousand words to say what he wants to say
the sound and the fury yes began as a short story
i thought that that could be done in ten pages
it couldnt its not finished yet
yes your play requiem for a nun was translated into french and put on the stage pretty successfully
i was wondering do you think that could be done here in the states in an english version
yes it could be done
the reason its not done in america is i gave a young woman who wants to bean actress and she has has had bad luck
she s ambitious
she works hard but she has nt been successful i gave her the right to it and since she has no reputation or name nobody will put up the money it costs to put on a play in this country and i wont take it away from her
that s why its been knocking about europe for about five or six years
i notice in a lot of your books you use double words words that are usually used singularly and that are joined together
what effect are you trying to create with that and why is it in some novels you use them in the beginning of the book and then in the middle or the end you dont use them that way
that i think goes back to the constant fear that probably every writer has
he he know she s a mortal
he has only a a limited number of years in which to work
he has found the world so amazing and and so marvelous and so moving that i believe i by the world i mean man human race the human problems that he is trying to get it all said before he dies that he is in in a sense trying to put the whole history of the human heart on the head of a pin and he is using any method that will will doi the thinks the most effective most moving way and sometimes making one word out of two seems tome the best and then again it it dont seem to be the right way to do it
its the that drive to get it all said while you can still have time to s ayiti think was the reason for the experimenting the style the method
that was the reason for joyce
you mentioned that the sound and the fury fury was still not finished
i was wondering do you feel that there s been a definite advantage in having the story more or less overlapping with others and keeping on in terms of continuity in an unfinished
well its its not finished in the sense that its kind of a story more or less overlapping with others and keeping on continuity it its unfinished well its its not finished in the sense that its not it dont suit me
its not as good as as i want it to be
none of my work is
that one i worked the hardest at i love the best and that one im more more anxious to finish it in away that ll suit me
i feel that if i had nt written it and could could go back and and do it over i would do it better
of course i wouldnt
i would do it the same way but i would if i had the chance i would do it better
maybe it would please me then
when you were in japan and talked to the young japanese writers did you find that their problems were the same as the young american writers
im sure they were but it was in ever did touch the japanese they all spoke english but it was like two people running at topspeed topspeed on opposite sides of a plate glass window
you could see the mouth move you could see the human features the gestures but there was no communication and then suddenly the paths parted and one went this way
that was all
there was no communication
im sure their problems were the same problems but their culture is so different
its a culture of of the intellectual process the result doesnt matter its the its for the wheels to click properly which is completely alien tome to any occidental but in ever did touch the japanese
but im quite sure that their problems were the same as mine and that if we could ve spoken to one another we would have benefited both of us but we simply couldnt the published book about it sounded as though you had touched them very much what they asked you seemed to have touched them
well i hope so but i wasnt aware of it at the time
they would ask me the same questions over and over and then answer them themselves i remember is aw the chief archer of japan
he had been knighted by the emperor
it was a ritual
the target was o has far from here to the bookcase and he would getup and go through certain motions to free his forearm from his kimono and then he would pace forward so many paces and bow to where the emperor would be
then he would getup and go through some more ritual and fit the arrow to the string and then he would pace towards the target and stop and turn and do a sort of a ballet almost and draw the arrow back and let it go and sometimes it hit the target but that didnt matter
nobody cared you see
he had it was no trouble to hit it
it was only about as far as the bookcase i realize that i had committed a fearful it was more than a faux pas
it was les e majesty somehow
i had made a dreadful social error and that is the japanese we simply could not communicate
what do you expect of the future of the american novel as it is today
i think that as long as man exists on the earth he will continue to produce art
i think that the young writer who keeps on writing he learns more and more
he s got to waste a certain amount of his energy fending off from the pressure to make him conform to something to a group but there s nothing wrong about about writing in this country
it goes through dead times
it goes in cycles and the young man today may not come to his best powers until maybe another fifteen another twenty years
then suddenly there ll be another renaissance of of writing in this country what themes do you most expect to find in these writers coming now
im sorry
i couldnt hear that what themes do you think you dbe most apt to find in writers coming now
oh the only theme that is worth writing about that anyone ever has written about which is the human heart in conflict with itself its fellows and its environment its people
you write about people not about social conditions
they re only coincidental to it
the social condition is apart of the environment which which one writes from
that s part of your background and he writes from that just as you do from the observation but if you write about a social condition or an injustice you re a propagandist or a reporter
the novelist is writing about people the human heart in conflict with the same hopes and fears and aspirations its always had no matter what color of the skin or what race and the young writer if he will resist the pressure to make him conform to a group or a mass then he will will learn that the only thing worth writing about is the individual human heart and its own problems in conflict with itself man that wants to be better than he think she might be and suddenly he finds that he is better that he has done something brave or a man that wants to be be brave and failed they are the problems to write about not the social conditions and those are the problems that are eternal
they dont change
what i want to ask you do you get any reaction from readers of say your translated works where the non american reader is difficult or he distorts the meaning of american words
the only language i read with any ease is french and the french translation sive read have been very fine i thought
the others of course i dont know because im not familiar with the language and know too few well im not really a literary man to discuss books and things like that
im a countryman a farmer
i write as a hobby because its fun any other questions
whether you think its silly or not ask it
or when you novelist is the difference in what you what no
i have nt had time to think about it
ive been too busy writing books that that goes back to how i just said im not a literary man you see
i dont think of myself as having any position any particular niche in the establishment of literature
i think of myself as having a particular niche in the establishment of of farming of of raising grain to feed cattle and horses but not as as a literary man and i think that probably when the writer runs dry and he has nothing more to say or know then he begins to think of his position as of literary import but while he she s busy writing i doubt if he has the time to have thought about it too much because he s still trying to write a book which pleases him
that s why he writes another one because the one he finished is not quite good enough to suit him so he writes another one and tries it again
i have a very specific question which i think will come under the category of silly frequently in your works the story is told by a narrator and his personality has a strong influence in your work and this just seems tome frequently very similar to the use of the narrator that conrad uses particularly in marlow
had you by any chance read conrad in your youth
yes and did it conceivably have any influence on your use of such as i said everything the writer reads influences him but he himself cant say just how much what did when but im quite sure that conrad did though conrad wasnt the first one to use that method
at there s times when the story itself demands that that method be used that my experience is that once i have thought about the characters until they come alive they stand up and casta shadow then they take charge of the story
i run along at their heels at a dead run trying to put down what they say and do they have taken charge and they re the ones that demand which methods hall be used
if you do read them how seriously do you take your critics that is those people who write in the literary magazines hudson review and so forth
do you think its particularly rewarding for students to read the critics of your work
i should think so
i dont read that sort of thing
i mim too busy
but i should think it might be be valuable for for students to read that
im sure it would be valuable but the writer if he s as busy a siam and has got as much that he needs to say as i have and know she never will livelong enough to say it all he a in t got time to read what anybody else says about his work because he already knows what it is it a in t good enough that s why he s writing another
a young lady up here
do you enjoy writing more about the people in your own locale of oxford mississippi than of other countries and nations
i write about the people in my own country because its simpler
i dont have to do any research
i know the mim writing about people not about mississippian s
i simply use mississippi because that s what i know best
i dont have to hunt around to keep from making mistakes that somebody would catch me out on but ii write to yes i write because its fun not for glory but because its its fun to do
yes ma am how great do you feel the french influence is on the american novel today
now that question i cant answer because the reading ido is the books that i knew and loved when i was twenty one years old
i haven tread a new book in fifteen twenty years and i dont know literary or writing people and ii couldnt attempt to answer that question because i dont know enough about it
but i would say that there is a great deal of influence because the french writers the young writers have been the most most prominent lately
sartre and and camus
people like that seem to be doing better work than than the writers of any other country at the present and i would say that they have had a great influence on the young american writers i think
would you mind telling us what some of the books are that you knew and loved when you were twenty one
don quixote most of dickens moby dick the brothers karamazov madame bovary the old testament
i have a one volume shakespeare which i carry around with me
balzac i read a little in that every year
conrad i read some of conrad almost every year that s there re a few more that i dont recall now but but they are the one sim never too far from and i read every year
yes i thought of the whole story at once like a bolt of lightning lights up a landscape and you see everything but it takes time to write it and this story ive had in my mind for about thirty years and the one which i will do next it it happened at that same moment thirty years ago and it was sort of a matter of getting at it is this a unique situation or have other sequences occurred to you like quentin comp son in both the sound and the fury and ab salom ab salom
no
i used quentin in ab salom ab salom
as a protagonist
his story was in the sound and the fury
i just suddenly needed quentin comp son
in the sense that he belonged to mei just reached around and got him
mr
faulkner
you re sometimes quoted assaying that sanctuary was a potboiler
will you repudiate that idea
i would like for you i would like to repudiate it for you if you dont
well that book was basely conceived
i had had written and had never made much money and i when i was footloose i could do things to make money
i could could run a bootlegging boat i was a commercial airplane pilot things like that then i got married and i couldnt do things like that anymore and so i thought i would make a little money writing a book
and i thought of the most horrific idea i could think of and wrote it and sent it to the publisher and he wrote me back
he said good lord if we print this well both be in jail
that was about about i think when you couldnt say things in print like you can now
so i forgot it
i wrote two more books
they were published and the none day i got the galleys for sanctuary and i read it and probably it was because i didnt need money so badly then but anyway is aw what a a base thing it was in concept what what a shabby thing it was and so i wrote the publisher and said lets throw it away
he didnt have much money at that time
he said we cant do that because ive had plates made and that costs something
and i said well ill just have to rewrite it
and he said all right you rewrite it and ill pay half of the new plates and you pay half of the new plates
so i rewrote it did the best i could with it
i got a job passing coal to earn the two hundred and seventy dollars to pay my half for the plates for printing the book and then the publisher went bankrupt
i didnt get any money at all so it i did the best i could with with the book
it was in away already in the public domain
i couldnt throw it away and and i rewrote it and did the best i could with it mr
faulkner you liked the characters in it enough though to write requiem of a nun later
well there was nothing wrong with the characters in it
it was the story itself the first draft of it
the second draft was the best i could do with it and so im not ashamed of the second draft because it was the best i could do
it wasnt good enough but it was the best i could do and they did establish a problem that demanded the question what happened what could come of of this marriage founded on that any other questions silly or otherwise well were very very grateful to you sir
thankyou sir thankyou ladies
and i hope you will take mr gwynn a this word of anything
no matter how silly it might sound to you ask it
ive talked to several young gentlemen and they tell me that theresa feeling that the question has got to be one that the answer er will approve of
i think that s not not a very good idea so ask anything that you like
sometimes ive heard it said that joe christmas in light in august is supposed to be a christ figure now there s some allusion to that or perhaps some evidence for it
he died at a this lynching
theresa few things like that
did you intend for him to be a christ figure
no not deliberately
that was coincidental
the writer has a storeroom of of recollections of traditions of experience of observation that he uses in his trade just as the carpenter has a storeroom of planks that he uses when he wants to build a fence or a house and that s coincidental
iam writing about people not about symbols but when it seems tome the symbol is a good trick to use then i will use the symbol can you put that microphone a little closer to you or something oh it isnt
well ill ill try to speak louder the nmr
faulkner
this is a silly question but im curious about your daily habits of writing
do you make yourself write so often everyday or do you wait for the mood
or
no iam a very disorderly person
i dont know anything about discipline and that system works with some writers but it never has worked with me
i put off writing as long as i can because i dont like the mechanics of of getting the words down on paper
i put it off as long as possible and then when i cant put it off any longer i seem to have generated enough back pressure to where it goes for or hours someday sometimes
then i will goto bed and sleep and i will eat
then i will write again for tenor twelve hours the next day until the steam runs out and then i will do nothing as long as i can put it off
in your book light in august would you say that the incidents that occurred there were taken from life that you actually happen to know about or were they more or less your imagination
could you could you give me some idea if its half imagination and half truth or the writer has three sources imagination observation and experience and he probably cant say himself just how much of which he has used when
ido think that he feels that he can improve just a little on on the world as god made it and on people as god made them because he has got to do his job in well five hours where god can take sixty years to complete a a human being
i think that the writer himself dont knowhow much he saw how much he imagined how much he remembered how much he read but he certainly has no compunctions about taking what he needs from any source
he will steal from another writer without hesitation he will use his own observation his own experience without hesitation no matter how unhappy or how shameful it might have been
because he is trying to create flesh and blood people that will have three dimensions that will can stand up and casta shadow behind them
do you believe that all fiction has to be plotted at the beginning a body and an ending in your mind or go ahead and work it out
some people have to have a plot a framework to begin on
in ever did because i think of of mine as as people the characters and once they have come alive and have three dimensions then they take charge of the story
all ido is to run along at topspeed behind them and try to put it all down that they do and say
ive never never used a plot and and in my own case i would waste my time if i tried to think of a plot
i probably couldnt think of a plot
is your opinion of tennyson in light in august as expressed by high towers remark that reading tennyson is like listening in a cathedral to a eunuch chanting in a language which he does not even need to not understand is that your opinion of tennyson
no sir that was high towers opinion and im not responsible for his opinion i have a different opinion of tennyson myself that when i was younger i read tennyson with a great deal of pleasure
i can tread him at all now
i should think that his mother dinned that into him as soon as he was big enough to remember and that he came deliberately to hunt out his father not for for justice for himself but for revenge for his abandoned mother
he must have known that that must have been in his the background of his childhood that this this abandoned woman never let him forget that
possibly yes
yes when he located s ut pen knew that s ut pen was a wealthy man in his time yeshe thought there would be gain but bon didnt want gain he wanted revenge for his mother then isnt that a fairly close parallel to the whole oedipus situation
noi cant say
it maybe the writer is so busy writing his own characters that he has nt got time to find where they follow classical patterns
it maybe that since problems of the human heart are constant they dont change that the dramatic shape of of mans conflict with himself and his fellows or and his environment do follow a pattern
maybe they re that the story of oedipus was not the story of oedipus at all
it was the story of any man in that situation that the patterns there re too few stories that one can tell
there re only two or three stories actually and any writer has got to repeat what was written before him
you say that your characters create the situation
do you know your characters very very well before you start your stories or do you depend upon them knowing them more thoroughly as you go along writing
i think i know them very well because of the laziness i mentioned
i put off writing it as long as possible but its still going on churning around up here and when they become when i know them completely that s when the urge is irresistible
ive got to get to work then
so i imagine that i know the character pretty well though they do surprise me too in what they do
when you write a series of books or two or three concerning the same characters like the hamlet and then a number of years later write the town when you finish the hamlet do you say yourself well im through with these people there they are and you leave them with no intention of going on later and picking them up again and then they become active in your mind again and you ve got to do something else with them or did you have an idea of writing a trilogy when you started the hamlet
that was a complete intact idea
when i thought off lem s nope si saw like a flash of lightening the whole story from frenchmen s bend on through jefferson to his death
when i began to write it is aw that it couldnt bei thought at first it could be done in one volume
i found out it couldnt and when id written about a hundred thousand words i knew i had to quit
nobody would read more than that so it would have to be another volume but the story was intact as soon as i thought off lem s nope s
how far do you think the relationship between charles bon and s ut pen parallels what you consider the general racial situation in the south
it was a manifestation of a general racial system in the south which was condensed and concentrated as the writer has got to do with any incident or any character he takes for the reason that he has nt got sixty years
he has got to do his job in between the covers of a book but that is epitomized a constant general condition in the south yes
yes sir sir do you think the south can handle the problem of desegregation and integration better if they are left alone or do you think that calvinism or narrow mindedness that you expressed in a lot of your books is present and if so do you think that they will wont get rid of it
i think that the southerner the provincial backwoods southerner will have to be let alone because he is he is ignorant he is proud and he is limited to where he will let nobody tell him what he must do
its a childish sort of recalcitrance that anyone when he is told that he must do something he will do the opposite just to show them
it becomes a principle with him
he knows that he is wrong that he has a condition which must be changed and he has been trying to change it by his own methods
he s too slow about it
he should ve known that this supreme court decision would be made
there was a lawyer in my town that told people fifteen years ago that sooner or later the supreme court would have to say that but nobody believed him
they were in their their slow way they were doing things to improve the negros condition
when the supreme court decision came out saying they must do it now people that were working in their slow way toward it took the other side
they say that the government shall not tellus what we will do can do must do in our own country with our own people with our own culture and system
there are so many parallels of violence in your writings which suggest the actions of the ku klux klan iam curious to know why you have never mentioned it directly that i know of
the the spirit that move saman to put on a sheet and and burn sticks in your yard is is pretty prevalent in mississippi but not all mississippian swear the sheet and burn the sticks
that they scorn and and hate the and look with contempt on the people that do but the same spirit the same impulse is in them too but they are going to use a different method from wearing a nightshirt and burning sticks
the the ku klux klan is the dull dreary minority
there s nothing dramatic enough in the ku klux klan forme to have needed to use that in a story though i cant say that someday i wont need to use it
siri was disturbed by are mark you made in ab salom ab salom
you said that charles bon made his half sister the vessel of love for his half brother
i didnt quite understand that
i will have to read that book again
i dont remember that myself
ii will have to if mr
gwynn would lookup that passage forme if you remember it then ill read it and the next time we have a meeting ask that again and ill maybe i can have an answer for you mr
faulkner
i wonder if when you write you have a particular definite effect in mind that you want to achieve or do you want the reader to bring their own experience into focus interaction which will produce immediate reactions
yes but that is also coincidental
i think the writer is has thought of something from observation imagination or experience of man in conflict with himself with his problems which is so moving that to him it is worth showing to other people and he tries to show it to other people in the most effective way
if it seems to him its best to ask the reader to do a little work too then he does it that way
if its best to be explicit he does it that way
but its no deliberate desire to make reading the reading difficult to anyone at all
he is simply trying to show something which moved him so much he thought it was important enough to put down on paper so that other people could see that this was true this was moving this was funny or it was tragic or this is man in conflict with his eternal problems
was the fact that the sound and the fury was written so confusingly the fact that its a story told by an idiot
why why is it introduced backwards and forwards at different times
it seemed to be the most moving way to tell that story was to show what that idiot child saw
i wrote that
i thought that would be all of it and then i realized that wasnt enough so i had to write more
the nile t another brother tell it and that wasnt enough soil et the third brother the second brother tell it and that still wasnt enough and the nile t faulkner try it for a while and that still wasnt enough
that book is still not finished that in ever did tell something which seemed so true and so moving and so tragic and so passionately beautiful tome that i wanted to show it to people and i didnt do it
it was a failure
in the sound and the fury can you tell me exactly why some of that is written in italics
what does that denote
i had to use some method to indicate to the reader that this idiot had no sense of time that what happened to him ten years ago was just yesterday the the way i wanted to do it was to use different colored inks but that would have cost so much the publisher couldnt undertake it doesnt that goon with quentin too
yes because he was about halfway between madness and sanity
it wasnt as much as as in ben jy s part because quentin was only halfway between ben jy and jason
jason didnt need italics because he was quite sane and another thing i noticed you dont advise that people have to have a subject a predicate and a verb and all those things
well i think that s really not a fair question i was i was trying to tell this story as it seemed tome that idiot child saw it
and that idiot child tome didnt know what a question what an interrogation was
he didnt know too much about grammar
he spoke only through his sense sim referring mostly to quentin and he certainly he attended harvard
he should have known
well quentin was an educated half madman and so he dispensed with grammar
because it was all clear to his half mad brain and it seemed to him it would be clear to anybody else s brain that what he saw was quite logical quite clear
in the town do italics indicate time annotation
were the italics in the town used as they were in the sound and the fury
i dont remember that book either
that was a year ago
i think that the italics there were mostly for emphasis though there could ve been times when i used italics to indicate that something definitely distant in the past had been brought into the present
i dont remember but then that s has become more or less a universal trick i think to use italics for that reason to bring into the present something out of the distant past
this is another nave question
in trying to get at a meaning that ties all the characters together in light in august it seems that all of them in one way or another have been deprived of love in one form or another and are trying to find something
did it have some sort of meaning like that to you
that s that s possible
of course i didnt think of that at the time
i was simply writing about people but that s that s possible
that s that s valid
but that too was coincidental with the writer well they were all put into difficult circumstances more or less cutoff sort of
well yes but then so many people are
so many people are seeking something and and and quite often it is love
it dont have to be love between a man and woman
its to be be one with some universal force power that goes through life through the world
it could take the form of the object of it could beaman or woman because that is a apart of mans or womans instinctive nature to have an object an immediate object to project that seeking for love on
are you in your in your statement just made it seems that you are more a partisan of the lamarckian theory of evolution than you are of the darwinian theory
however as you know clearly the mechanical version of the step by step process is not related to universal force whereas as you just now did and i wondered if you had obtained that idea by early reading of butler samuel butler who took lamarckian theory i cant say
i think that there are some beliefs that maybe one inherits that he dont have to get from through an intellectual process like reading
probably i that was simply apart of me that there must be some universal electricity that holds this ramshackle earth together
which one of your works do you prefer and what
the one that failed the best which was the sound and the fury
none of them are quite good enough to suit me yet
that s why i keep on writing another one
i like the sound and the fury because that gave me the most anguish the most trouble
i think a students natural reaction after writing a paper or something atleast to hand in at school is to hand it to his roommate or somebody close to him and have him read it and give an opinion on it
do you do this after you ve written a story or a novel
is there anybody in your family or close friends that you give it to and just say what do you think of this
no because i have more confidence in my own judgment than anybody else s and i know that it dont suit me yet so i have never thought of showing it to anybody else because i dont really care what they think
it has nt suited me yet
probably if i dodo something that does suit mei will worry and harass everybody to death to look at it
would you say that you work primarily to express yourself or more to communicate to others
i would say i write primarily because its fun
in the book sanctuary could you tellus how you feel about the story or what brought you to write it to bring it out
i have told this before
if any of you were at the class and heard it please forgive us
i had written several books
i didnt need money then because i was single and footloose and there were things i could do for money
i was a bootlegger
i was a commercial aeroplane pilot
then i got married and i needed money and i had had got the curse of writing then so i thought i would make a little money writing a book and i thought of the most horrific story i could imagine and wrote it sent it to the publisher and he wrote back good god if we print this well both be in jail
so i wrote two more books and forgot about it the none day i got the galley proofs of sanctuary and i looked at it and i didnt need money then probably though i like to think that i had gotten my breath and could see that the whole thing was basely conceived for a base purpose and i wrote the publisher lets throw it away
he said we cant do that because i have spent money to have plates made
and i said well ill have to rewrite it because i cant let it be printed this way
and he said all right if you will pay your half of the new plates ill pay half and you can rewrite it
so i got a job and earned the two hundred and seventy dollars to pay my half of the new plates and rewrote the book and this time i did the best i could with it
i mim not ashamed of the book as it is
im ashamed of the primary base notion to write something to make money which i shouldnt have done that i betrayed something somewhere when i when i did that but i did the best i could with the material as it was and so im not ashamed of the book now
its not one that i would do again but im not ashamed of it
yes that s right
it was i began to think what would be the future of that girl and then i thought of what could a marriage come to which was founded on the vanity of a of a weak man
what would be the outcome of that
and suddenly that seemed tome dramatic and and worthwhile but that was you requite right
i had nt thought of that when i wrote sanctuary
from your remarks i would say that you have a belief that in developing the characters in the story that the writer also develops maybe didi gather is that correct
im sure he does that the writer is learning all the time he writes and and he learns from his own people
once he has conceived them truthfully and has stuck to the verities of of human conduct human behavior human aspirations then he learns
yes they teach him they surprise him they teach him things that he didnt know
they do things and suddenly he says to himself why yes that is true that is so
referring to an earlier question did you say that light in august argues for the acceptance of an inevitably tragic view of life
i wouldnt think so that the only person in that book that accepted a tragic view of life was christmas because he didnt know what he was and so he deliberately repudiated man
he didnt belong to man any longer
he deliberately repudiated man
the others seemed tome to have had a very fine belief in in life in the basic possibility for happiness and goodness byron bunch and lena grove to have gone to all that trouble
this genealogy with all these people that were connected with each other them cc as lins and everybody was that made up before the books were written or as each one was written
no that came along as these people appeared
i would think of of one character to write a story about and suddenly he would drag in a lot of people in ever saw or heard of before and so the genealogy developed itself
some of your names in your books are very suggestive very highly suggestive
i wonder if its that or just pure coincidence or did you intend to make names like gail high tower joanna burden as being symbolic of their own personal character
well that is out of the tradition of the pre memory of the old miracle plays the morality plays in early english literature chaucer
well only s ut pen had a grand design
s nope s s design was pretty base
he just wanted to get rich
he didnt care how
s ut pen wanted to get rich only incidentally
he wanted to take revenge for all the redneck people against the aristocrat who told him togo around to the backdoor
he wanted to show that he could establish a dynasty too
he could make himself a king and raise a a line of princes
nono he only found out when he thought it was almost too late that he d have to have respectability
he didnt want it until he found out he had to have it
he would have done without it if he could but he suddenly had to have it
in this democracy of ours is not money an assumed respectability regardless of conduct
not always
i imagine a man like dave beck a in t very interested in respectability he dont symbolize respectability but he s got a lot of money
this callous attitude of s ut pen and fl ems nope s this ability to use people without realizing they re people sort of dehumanizing them it seems to progress and get worse as they go from the country into towns and cities
is that is that a definite is that a conscious thing
it didnt get worse because they came into cities
they had to come into cities to find more people to use
but it it got worse because of the contempt which which the ability to use people develops in anyone
there are very few people that have enough grandeur of soul to be able to use people and not develop contempt for
and that the contempt for people came not because they moved to the city but out of success
when did you think of the title of light in august for your book
was it after you had written the story and and what is it exactly
tome to a to people in my country that is a a pleasant evocative sentence
theresa certain quality that for a little while in the month of august light has that it has at no other time
theresa a luminosity in which something pagan might live and flourish just for a few days
that s all it meant
it was just a nice pleasant evocative sentence tome
it really has little to do with the book
i have two questions
one of them relates to this idea of money wouldnt you say that the gentleman is confusing the traditions of the north with the traditions of the south the south the old south is best pictured in the ideals in the story arose for emily where the old woman gets along without the money and keeps up the family traditions
dont you think that there would be a distinction as far as the respectability in this
yes there is
in the south respectability has little connection with money
money dont hurt the respectability but the respectability dont need the money in the south
you requite right wouldnt this be shown in the sound and the fury too
jason would be trying to get money whereas the rest of the family they dont care and the negroes really regard them as respectable people
that s right yes they regard jason as white trash
yes that s right and i would like to ask you on this business of the old south and the new south in the bear where the young boy returns a saman and sees the forest cut down i would like to know do you like the old south or the new south better
well the new south has got too many people in it and it is changing the country too much
it has it it gets rid of of the part of mississippi that i liked when i was when i was young which was the forest
though its foolish to be against progress because everyone is apart of progress and hell have no other chance except this one so he its silly not to cope with it to compromise with it cope with it
probably anyone remembers with something of nostalgia the his young years
he forgets the unpleasant the unhappy things that happened here members only the nice things and so maybe the northerner feels the same way about the old north and the new north that the southerner feels about the old south and the new south
sir about this new south this last supreme court school decision has made all the states around here go through quite a bit of gyrations plotting and planning things but very little is heard about or seen in the newspapers about what mississippi for instance plans to do about it or what is being done or what they rethinking
i was wondering whether you could give some light on that
well mississippi is pretty well on record about what they think and and what they re going to do
they have proved it two or three times and that will be the last stronghold of of the obsolescence which insists that a minority of seventeen million people still must be second rate second class citizens
we will be the ones that will hold on to that after everybody else has realized that it just dont work any longer
we will still believe that it can be made somehow to work
in part answer to the gentleman s question i think in a recent life magazine there was an article about your governor
it was citing the progress being made in mississippi as as far as the schools were concerned how the governor will just as you said he will standby segregation until his last dying breath but he will do all that he can to improve the colored schools
this one is a better man than anybody in mississippi expected
i imagine if they had known his true sentiments they would never have elected him in mississippi and he is i have had some correspondence with him since he was elected and every now and then he sends me copies of letters he writes to his legislature and every now and then he quotes me things that i have said on the subject of segregation and he is someone that realizes that sees that this is an obsolescence that simply a in t going to work any longer
something must be done about it
but he has got to represent his state too and he cannot come out for a sudden abolishment of segregation but he knows that something must be done and he thinks that as a lot of people in mississippi do that all the negro wants is equality is educational economic equality that he dont want to mix with white people anymore than white people want to mix with him and the governor says that if he has decent schools as good schools as he could get anywhere if he has has the right togo where he wants to into white churches if he wants togo there into the white stores as he can do that that will solve the question
as someone has said apparently the difficulty is the mississippian dont want the negro to s it down with him
they can stand up that s alright
they can ride in the same elevator but they cants it in the same church
maybe if everybody stood up in church the negro could come in too
mr faulkner in your book as i lay dying do you you feel that you strayed from your main mission of writing that is the writing of people since what i feel is the main character in that the dead grandmother who suffered the majority of the pain and the torment in having her face have auger holes bored in it and floating down the creek in a coffin and eventually burning the barn
she she being dead could feel none of this torment and i just wondered if that was sort of an aside from your main mission in writing about people since she being dead is no longer a person
noi dont think so
i was writing about people
i took a family of of the people that i know well
i dont mean that i that the bund rens actually live in mississippi but their their kind live there
that was tour de force
i simply took this group of of country people and subjected them to the two great catastrophes flood and fire
that was simple tour de force
i wrote that in about six weeks without changing a word because i knew from the beginning where that book was going because that in away did have a plot
sir did joyce s ulysses ulysses have any affect on light in august
it has probably had influence on everything i ever wrote just like everything else i ever read has from the telephone directory up and down
i think that everything the writer reads influences his work that he is completely amoral he has no hesitancy whatever about taking what he wants from any source he wants because he knows that anyone after him is welcome to use anything that he has discovered or invented
but i dont believe the writer has time to say now im going to write a book and let joyce influence it or im going to write a book and let flaubert influence it
he is simply writing about people and he use she reaches back in his lumber room and gets whatever plank fits the corner
i just wanted to say that the theory of parallel cases in evolution of two plants at the opposite ends of the country developing in the same way and i dont see why it couldnt happen in the writers experience that it was that certain devices were the same shouldnt necessarily mean that perhaps one was influenced by the other to be able to develop from the writer in parallel cases with perhaps no communication and i wondered if is that s the case in light in august
it it could well be because there are only a limited number of stories to tell and only a limited number of ways in which to tell them so that s something that the writer couldnt answer either whether that was some form of osmosis or whether it was an actual cribbing from what he had read or whether two impulses did develop for at at poles apart he its impossible to say though i agree with your theory that that s very possible that it could be done because there reso few stories to tell so few methods to tell them in
thankyou
ive had no trouble yet when i have been in new england
i would have to listen to it and get into the habit of of remembering to use their own terms their own diction but there was no difficulty about understanding what they meant well you have dealt with english speech in in some of your short stories and french speech in a fable it seems tome
probably not
the colonel wouldnt have said wh upped
he by by nature he might ve have said wh upped but he had associated with gentlefolk and other plantation owners long enough to have said whipped without knowing he was changing his speech
but wash would still have said wh upped just like the negro would say wh upped
or or a gob that s right a blob yes
ive ive heard that in england
mmhmm
the overwhelming i think that s one of the most interesting passages from the point of view of what happens to speech under the stress of strong emotion
at the beginning of his sermon he speaks very properly and with elegant enunciation and diction and at the end there san immense difference i think
yes
that s right
that s right were off the air fellows well how about it
why dont you ask it
well save that for next week then
no he would have said s hur
there would be a littler and with wash there wouldnt be one one of the most interesting words i found i think is s holly
when i notice peace officers very often seem to say that in the books
yes
its the only only reading a lot of them do
and its the only speech delivered by one introductory announcer individual noi dont know that wed be interested in hearing it would you gentlemen i had a speech all prepared tonight but ive forgotten what it was so ill just say that i would like to introduce to you an old hand on this campus
he s been around so long now that he s really become one of us mr william faulkner who is going to entertain you now
when he and uncle buck ran back to the house from discovering that to mey st url had run again they heard uncle buddy cursing and bellowing in the kitchen then the fox and the dogs came out of the kitchen and crossed the hall into the dogs room and they heard them run through the dogs room into his and uncle bucks room then they saw them cross the hall again into uncle buddy s room and heard them run through uncle buddy s room into the kitchen again and this time it sounded like the whole kitchen chimney had comedown and uncle buddy bellowing like a steamboat blowing and this time the fox and the dogs and five or six sticks of firewood all came out of the kitchen together with uncle buddy in the middle of them hitting at everything insight with another stick
it was a good race
when he and uncle buck ran into their room to get uncle bucks necktie the fox had treed behind the clock on the mantel uncle buck got the necktie from the drawer and kicked the dogs off and lifted the fox down by the scruff of the neck and shoved it back into the crate under the bed and they went to the kitchen where uncle buddy was picking the breakfast up out of the ashes and wiping it off with his apron
what in damn shell do you mean he said turning that damn fox out with the dogs all loose in the house
damn the fox uncle buck said
to mey st url has broke out again
give me and cass some breakfast quick
we might just barely catch him before he gets there
because they knew exactly where to mey st url had gone he went there everytime he could slip off which was about twice a year
he was heading for mr hubert beauchamp s place just over the edge of the next county that mr hubert s sister miss soph on sib amr hubert was a bachelor too like uncle buck and uncle buddy was still trying to make people call warwick after the place in england that she said mr hubert was probably the true earl of only he never even had enough pride not to mention energy to take the trouble to establish his just rights
to mey st url would go there to hang around mr hubert s girl ten nie until somebody came and got him
they couldnt keep him at home by buying ten nie from mr hubert because uncle buck said he and uncle buddy had so many niggers already that they could hardly walk around on their own land for them and they couldnt sell to mey st url to mr hubert because mr hubert said he not only wouldnt buy to mey st url he wouldnt have that damn white half m cc asl in on his place even as a free gift not even if uncle buck and uncle buddy were to pay board and keep for him
and if somebody didnt go and get to mey st url right away mr hubert would fetch him back himself bringing miss soph on sib a and they would stay for a week or longer miss soph on sib a living in uncle buddy s room and uncle buddy moved clean out of the house sleeping in one of the cabins in the quarters where the niggers used to live in his great grandfathers time until his great grandfather died and uncle buck and uncle buddy moved all the niggers into the big house which his great grandfather had not had time to finish and not even doing the cooking while they were there and not even coming to the house anymore except to s it on the front gallery after supper sitting in the darkness between mr hubert and uncle buck until after a while even mr hubert would give up telling how many morehead of niggers and acres of land he would add to what he would give miss soph on sib a when she married and goto bed
and one midnight last summer uncle buddy just happened by accident to wake and hear mr hubert drive out of the lot and by the time he waked them and they got miss soph on sib a up and dressed and the team put to the wagon and caught mr hubert it was almost daylight
so it was always he and uncle buck who went to fetch to mey st url because uncle buddy never went anywhere not even to town and not even to fetch to mey st url from mr hubert seven though they all knew that uncle buddy would have risked it ten times as much as uncle bud buck buck could have dared
now did you want us togo to is that enough there or did you want us togo to the fox to the poker game yes
i think reading about the poker prowess
and let me see if i can find this one now
not too long yes oh yes you can read it if your voice doesnt give outlets see
you might explain it they re simply been trying to catch to mey st url
then you might begin about here where they are going back into the bedroom again
the yate breakfast fast
uncle buck put on his necktie while they were running toward the lot to catch the horses
the only time he wore the necktie was on to mey st urls account and he had nt even had it out of the drawer since that night last summer when uncle buddy had waked them in the dark and said getup and out of that bed and damn quick
uncle buddy didn town a necktie at all uncle buck said uncle buddy wouldnt take the chance even in a section like their s where ladies were so damn seldom thank god that a man could ride for days in a straight line without having to dodge a single one
his grandmother she was uncle bucks and uncle buddy s sisters he had raised him following his mothers death
that was where he had go this christian name m cc asl in carothers m cc asl in edmonds said that uncle buck and uncle buddy both used the necktie just as another way of daring people to say they looked like twins because even at sixty they would still fight anyone who claimed he could tell could not tell them apart whereupon his father had answered that any man whoever played poker once with uncle buddy would never misjudge him again for uncle buck or anybody else
jonas had the two horses saddled and waiting
uncle buck didnt mount a horse like he was any sixty years old either lean and active as a cat with his round close cropped whitehead and his hard little gray eyes and his white stubble d jaw his foot in their on and the horse already moving already running at the open gate when uncle buck came into the seat
he scrabbled up too on to the shorter pony before jonas could boost him up clapping the pony with his heels into its own stiff short coupled canter out the gate after uncle buck when uncle buddy he had nt even noticed him stepped out from the gate and caught the bit
watch him uncle buddy said
watch theophilus the minute anything begins to look wrong you ride to hell back here and get me
you hear
yes sir he said
lemme go now
i wont even ketch uncle buck let alone to mey st url uncle buck was riding black john because if they could just catch sight of to mey st url atleast one mile from mr hubert s gate black john would ride him down in two minutes
so when they came out on the long flat about three miles from mr hubert s sure enough there was to mey st url on the jake mule about a mile ahead uncle buck flung his arm out and back reining in crouched on the big horse his little round head and his gnarled neck thrust forward like a cooter s
stole away
he whispered
you stay back where he wont see you and flush
ill circle him through the woods and we will bay him at the creek ford
he waited until uncle buck had vanished into the woods
then he went on
but to mey st url saw him
he was closed he closed in too fast maybe he was afraid he wouldnt be there in time to see him when he treed
it was the best race he had ever seen
he had never seen old jake go that fast and nobody had ever known to mey st url togo faster than his natural walk even riding a mule
uncle buck whooped once from the woods running on sight then black john came out of the trees driving soup led out flat and level as a hawk with uncle buck right up up behind his ears now and yelling so they looked exactly like a big black hawk with a sparrow riding it across the field and over the ditch and across the next field and he was running too them are went out before he even knew she was ready he was yelling too
because being a nigger to mey st url should have jumped down and run for it a foot as soon as he seen them
but he didnt maybe to mey st url had been running off from uncle buck for so long that he had even got used to running away like a whiteman would do it
and it was like he and old jake had added to mey st urls natural walking speed to the best that old jake had ever done in his life and it was just exactly enough to beat uncle buck to the ford
because when he and the pony arrived uncle black john was blown and lathered and uncle buck was down leading him around in a circle slow to slow him down and they could already hear mr hubert s dinner horn a mile away
only for a while to mey st url didnt seem to beat mr hubert s either
the boy was still sitting on the gatepost blowing the horn there was no gate there just two posts and a nigger boy about his size sitting on one of them blowing a fox horn this was what miss soph on sib a was still reminding people was named warwick even when they had already known for along time that s what she aimed to have it called until they wouldnt call it warwick she wouldnt even seem to know what they were talking about and it would sound as if she and mr hubert owned two separate plantations covering the same area of ground one on top of the other
mr hubert was sitting in the spring house with his boots off and his feet in the water drinking a toddy
but nobody there had seen to mey st url for a time it looked like mr hubert couldnt even place who uncle buck was talking about
oh that nigger he said at last
well find him after dinner
only it didnt seem as if they were going to eat either
mr hubert and uncle buck had a toddy the nmr hubert finally sent to tell the boy on the gatepost he could quit blowing and he and uncle buck and had another toddy and uncle buck still saying i just want my nigger
then we got to get on back home
after dinner mr hubert said
if we dont start him somewhere around the kitchen well put the dogs on him
they ll find him if its in the power of mortal walker dogs to do it
but at last a hand began waving a handkerchief or something white through the broken place in an upstairs shutter
they went to the house crossing the back gallery mr hubert warning them again as he always did to watch out for the rotted floorboard he had nt got around to having fixed yet
then they stood in the hall until presently there was a jangling and swishing noise and they began to smell the perfume and miss soph on si bacame down the stairs
her hair was roach ed under a lace caps he had on her sunday dress and beads and a red ribbon around her throat and a little nigger girl carrying her fan and he stood quietly a little behind uncle buck watching her lips until they opened and he could see the roan tooth
he had never known anyone before with a roan tooth and he remembered how one time his grandmother and his father were talking about uncle buddy and uncle buck and his grandmother said that miss soph on sib a had matured into a fine looking woman once
maybe she had
he didnt know
he wasnt but nine
why mister theophilus she said
and m cc asl in she said
she had never looked at him and she wasnt talking to him and he knew it although he was prepared to balanced to drag his foot when uncle buck did
welcome to warwick
he and uncle buck dragged their foot
i just come to get my nigger uncle buck said
then we got to get on back home
then miss soph on sib a said something about a bumblebee but he couldnt remember that
it was to of a stand there was too much of it the earrings and beads clashing and jingling like little trace chains on a toy mule trotting and the perfume stronger too like the earrings and the beads sprayed it out each time they moved and he watched the roan colored tooth flick and glint between her lips something about uncle buck was a bee sipping from flower to flower and not staying long anywhere and all that stored sweetness to be wasted on uncle buddy s desert air calling uncle buddy mister a mode us like she called uncle buck mister theophilus or maybe the honey was being stored up against the advent of a queen and who was the lucky queen and when
ma am
uncle buck said
the nmr hubert said hah
a buck bee
i reckon that niggers going to think he s a buck hornet once he lays hands on him
but i reckon what bucks thinking about sipping right now is some meat gravy and biscuit and a cup of coffee
and so ami
they went into the dining room an date and miss soph on sib a said how seriously now neighbors just a half days ride apart ought not to be so long as uncle buck did and uncle buck said yes sum and miss soph on sib a said uncle buck was just a confirmed roving bachelor from the cradle born and this time uncle buck even quit chewing and looked at her and said yes ma am he sure was and born too late at it to ever change now but atleast he could thank god no lady would ever have to suffer the misery of living with him and uncle buddy and miss soph on sib a said ah then maybe uncle buck just a in t met the woman yet who would not only accept what uncle buck was pleased to call misery but who would make uncle buck consider even his freedom a small price to pay and uncle buck said nome
not yet
then he and mr hubert and uncle buck went out on the front gallery and s at down
mr hubert had nt even got done taking his shoes off again and inviting uncle buck to take his off when miss soph on si bacame out of the door carrying at ray with another toddy on it
damn it sib bey mr hubert said
he s just et
he dont want to drink now
miss but miss soph on sib a didnt seem to hear him at all
she stood there the roan tooth not flicking now but fixed because she wasnt talking now handing the toddy to uncle buck until after a while she said how her papa always said nothing sweetened amiss i ppi toddy like the hand of amiss i ppi lady and would uncle buck like to see how she use to sweeten her papas toddy for him
so she lifted the toddy and took as ip of it and handed it again to uncle buck and this time uncle buck took it
he dragged his foot again and drank the toddy and said if mr hubert was going to lay down he would lay down a while too since from the way things looked to mey st url was fixing to give them along hard race unless mr hubert s dogs were a considerable better than they used to be
mr hubert and uncle buck went into the house
after a while he got up too and went around to the backyard to wait for them the first thing he saw was to mey st urls head slipping along behind the lane fence
but when he cut across the yard to turn him to mey st url wasnt even running
he was squatting behind a bush watching the house peering around the bush at the backdoor and the upstairs windows not whispering exactly but not talking loud either w hut they doing now
they retaking a nap now he said
but nevermind that they re going to put the dogs on you when they getup
hah to mey st url said
and nem mind nem you mind that neither
i got protection now
all i needs to do is to keep old buck from k etching me unto i gets the word
what word
he said
word from who
is mr hubert going to buy you from uncle buck
huh to mey st url said again
i got more protection than w hut mr hubert got even
he rose to his feet
igo nter tell you something to remember anytime you wants to g it something done from hoeing out a crop to getting married just get the womenfolks to working at it
then all you needs to do is set down and wait
you member that
then to mey st url was gone
and after a while he went back to the house
but there wasnt anything but the snoring coming out of the room where uncle buck and mr hubert were and some more light sounding snoring coming from upstairs
he went to the spring house and s at with his feet in the water as mr hubert had been doing because now soon it would be cool enough for a race
and sure enough after a while mr hubert and uncle buck came out on to the back gallery with miss soph on sib a right behind them with the toddy tray only this time uncle buck drank his before miss soph on sib a had time to sweeten it and miss soph on sib a told them to get back early that all uncle buck knew of warwick was just dogs and niggers and now that she had him she wanted to show him her garden that mr hubert and nobody else had any say so in
yes sum uncle buck said
i just want to catch my nigger
then we got to get on back home
four or five niggers brought up the three horses they could already hear the dogs waiting still coupled in the lane and they mounted and went on down the lane toward the quarters with uncle buck already out in front of even the dogs
so he never did know just when and where they jumped to mey st url whether he flushed out of one of the cabins or not
uncle buck was away out in front on black john and they had nt even cast the dogs yet when uncle buck roared gone away
i godfrey he broke cover then
and black johns feet clapped four times like pistol shots while he was gathering togo out then he and uncle buck vanished over the hill like they had been like they had run at the blank edge of the world itself
mr hubert was roaring too gone away cast them
and they all piled over the crest of the hill just in time to see to mey st url away out across the flat almost to the woods and the dogs streaking down the hill and out on to the flat
they just tongued once and when they came boiling up around to mey st url it looked like they were trying to jump up and lick him in the face until even to mey st url slowed down and he and the dogs all went into the woods together walking like they were going home from a rabbit hunt and when they caught up with uncle buck in the woods there was no to mey st url and no dogs either just nothing but old jake about a half an hour later hitched into a clump of bushes with to mey st urls coat tied on him for a saddle and near half a bushel of mr hubert s oats scattered around on the ground that old jake never even had enough appetite left to nuzzle up and spit back out again
it wasnt any race at all
well get him tonight though mr hubert said
well bait for him
well throw a pic que t of niggers and dogs around tennies house about midnight and well get him
tonight hell uncle buck said
me and cass and that nigger all three are going to be halfway home by dark
a intone of your niggers got a fy ce or something that will trail them hounds
and fool around here in the woods for half the night too
mr hubert said
when ill bet you five hundred dollars that all you ve got to do to catch that nigger is to walk up to tennies cabin after dark and call him
five hundred dollars
uncle buck said
done
because me and him neither one a in t going to be anywhere near tennies house by dark
five hundred dollars
he and mr hubert glared at each other
done
mr hubert said
so they waited while mr hubert sent one of the niggers back to the house on old jake and in about a half an hour the nigger came back with a little bob tailed black fy ce and a new bottle of whisky
then he rode up to uncle buck and held something out to him wrapped in a piece of paper
what
uncle buck said
its for you the nigger said
then uncle buck took it and unwrapped it
it was a piece of red ribbon that had been on miss soph on sib as neck and uncle bucks at there on black john holding the ribbon like it was a little water moccasin only he wasnt going to let anybody see he was afraid of it batting his eyes fast at the nigger
then he stopped batting his eyes
what for
he said
she just son th it to you the nigger said
she say to tell you success
she said what
uncle buck said
i dont know sir the nigger said
she just say success
oh uncle buck said
and the fy ce found the hounds they heard them first from a considerable distance
it was just before sundown and they were not trailing they were not they were making the noise dogs make when they want to get out of something
they found out what that was too
it was aten foot square cotton house in a field about two miles from mr hubert s house and all eleven of the dogs were inside it and the door wedged with a chunk of wood
they watched the dogs come boiling out when the nigger opened the door mr hubert sitting his horse and looking at the back of uncle bucks neck
well well mr hubert said
that s something anyway
you can use them again now
they dont seem to have no trouble no more trouble with your nigger than he seems to have with them
not enough uncle buck said
that means both of them
ill stick to the fy ce
all right mr hubert said
then he said hell fil us come on
lets go eats upper
i tell you all you got to do to catch that nigger is five hundred dollars uncle buck said what
mr hubert said
he and uncle buck looked at each other
they were not glaring now
they were not joking each other either now
they s at there in the beginning of twilight looking at each other just blinking a little
what five hundred dollars
mr hubert said
that you wont catch that nigger in tennies cabin at midnight tonight
that me or that nigger neither a in t going to be near nobody s house but mine at midnight tonight
now they did glare at each other
five hundred dollars mr hubert said
done
done uncle buck said
done mr hubert said
done uncle buck said
so mr hubert took the dogs and some of the niggers and went back to the house
then he and uncle buck and the nigger with the fy ce went on the nigger leading old jake with one hand and holding the fy ces leash it was a piece of gnawed plow line with the other
now uncle buck let the fy ce smell to mey st urls coat it was like for the first time now the fy ce found out what they were after and they would have let him off the leash and kept up with him on the horses only about that time the nigger boy began blowing the fox horn for supper at the house and they didn td are risk it
then it was full dark
and then he didnt knowhow much later nor where they were how far from the house except that it was a good piece and it had been dark for good while and they were still going on with uncle buck leaning down leaning down from time to time to let the fy ce have another smell of to mey st urls coat while uncle buck took another drink from the whisky bottle they found that to mey st url had doubled and was making along swing back toward the house
i godfrey we ve got him uncle buck said
he s going to earth
well cutback to the house and head him before he can den
so they left the nigger to cast the fy ce and followed him on old jake and he and uncle buck rode on to mr hubert s stopping on the hills to blow the horses and listen to the fy ce down in the creek bottom where to mey st url was still making his swing
but they never caught him
they reached the dark quarters they could see lights still burning in mr hubert s house and somebody was blowing the fox horn again and it wasnt any boy and he had never heard a fox horn sound mad before and he and uncle buck scattered out on the slope below tennies cabin
then they heard the fy ce not trailing now but yapping about a mile away then the nigger whooped and they held the fy ce and they knew the fy ce had faulted
it was at the creek
they hunted the banks both ways for more than an hour but they couldnt straighten to mey st url out
at last even uncle buck gave up and they started back toward the house the fy ce riding too now in front of the nigger on the mule
they were just coming up the lane to the quarters they could see on on along the ridge to where mr hubert s house was all dark now when all of a sudden the fy ce gave a yelp and jumped down from old jake and hit the ground running and yelling every jump and uncle buck was down too and had snatched him off the pony almost before he could clear his feet from the irons and they ran too on past the dark cabins toward the one where the fy ce had treed
we got him
uncle buck said
runaround to the back
dont holler just grab up a stick and knock on the backdoor loud
afterward uncle buck admitted that it was his own mistake that he had forgotten when even a little child should have known not ever to stand right in front of or right behind a nigger when you scare him but always to stand to one side of him uncle buck forgot that
he was standing facing the front door and right in front of it with the fy ce right in front of him yelling fire and murder everytime it could draw a new breath he said the first he knew was when the fy ce gave a shriek and whirled and to mey st url was right behind it
uncle buck said he never saw the door open that the fy ce just screamed once and ran between his legs and then to mey st url ran right clean over him
he never even bobbled he knocked uncle buck down and then caught him up before he fell without even stopping snatched him up under one arm still running and carrying him along for about ten feet saying lookout of here old buck
lookout of here old buck before he threw him away and went on by that time they couldnt even hear the fy ce anymore at all
uncle buck wasnt hurt it was only the wind knocked out of him where to mey st url had thrown him down on his back
but he had been carrying the whisky bottle in his back pocket saving the last drink until to mey st url was captured and he refused to move until he knew for certain it was just whisky and not blood so uncle buck laid over on his side easy and he knelt behind him and raked the broken glass out of his pocket then they went on to the house
they walked
the nigger came up with the horses but nobody said anything to uncle buck about riding again
they couldnt hear the fy cea tall now
he was going fast all right uncle buck said but i dont believe that even he will catch that fy ce i godfrey what a night
well catch him tomorrow he said
tomorrow hell uncle buck said
well beat home tomorrow
and the first time hubert beauchamp or that nigger either one ever sets foot on my land im going to have them arrested for trespass and vagrancy
the house was dark
they could hear mr hubert snoring good no was if he had settled down to road gait in gat it
but they couldnt hear anything from upstairs even when they were inside the dark hall at the foot of the stairs
likely her room will beat the back uncle buck said
where she can holler down to the kitchen without having to getup
besides an unmarried lady wills holy have her door locked with strangers in the house
so uncle buck eased himself down on to the bottom step and he knelt and drew uncle bucks boots off then he removed his own and set them against the wall and he and uncle buck mounted the stairs feeling their way up and into the upper hall it was dark too and still there was no sound anywhere except mr hubert snoring below so they felt their way along the hall toward the front of the house until they felt a door
they could hear nothing beyond the door and when uncle buck tried the knob it opened
all right uncle buck whispered
be quiet
they could see a little now enough to see the shape of the bed and the mosquito bar
uncle buck threw down his suspenders and unbuttoned his trousers and went to the bed and eased himself carefully down on to the edge of it and he knelt again and drew uncle bucks trousers off and he was just removing his own when uncle buck lifted the mosquito bar and raised his feet and rolled into the bed
that was when miss soph on sib as at upon the other side of uncle buck and gave the first scream
when he reached home just before dinner time the next day he was just about worn out
he was too tired to eat even if uncle buddy had waited to eat dinner first he couldnt have stayed on the pony another mile without going to sleep
in fact he must have gone to sleep while he was telling uncle buddy because the next thing he knew it was late afternoon and he was lying on some hay in the jolting wagon bed with uncle buddy sitting on the seat above him exactly the same way he sata horse or satin his rocking chair before the kitchen hearth while he was cooking holding the whip exactly as he held the spork or fo on he stirred and tasted with
uncle buddy had some cold bread and meat and a jug of buttermilk wrapped in a in damp tow sacks waiting when he waked up
he ate sitting in the wagon in almost the last of the afternoon
they must have come fast because they were not more than two miles from mr hubert s
uncle buddy waited for him to eat then he said tell me again and he told it again how he and uncle buck finally found a room without anybody in it and uncle buck sitting on the side of the bed saying o godfrey cass
o godfrey cass and then they heard mr hubert s feet on the stairs and watched the light comedown the hall and mr hubert came in in his nightshirt and walked over and set the candle on the table and stood looking at uncle buck
well fil us he said
she s got you at last
it was an accident uncle buck said
is wear to godfrey hahm r hubert said
dont tell me
tell her that
i did uncle buck said
i did tell her
is wear to godfrey s holy mr hubert said
and just listen
they listened a minute
he had been hearing her all the time
she was nowhere near as loud as at first she was just steady
dont you want togo back in there and tell her again it was an accident that you never meant nothing and to just excuse you and forget about it
all right
all right what
uncle buck said
go back in there and tell her again mr hubert said
uncle buck looked at mr hubert for a minute
he batted his eyes fast
then what willi comeback and tell you
he said
tome
mr hubert said
i would call that a horse of another color
wouldnt you
uncle buck looked at mr hubert
he batted his eyes fast again
then he stopped again
wai the said
be reasonable
say i did walk into a lady s bedroom even miss soph on sib as say just for the sake of the argument there wasnt no other lady in the world but her and so i walked into her s and tried to get in bed with her would i would i have took a nine year old boy with me
reasonable is just what im being mr hubert said
you come into bear country of your own freewill and accord
all right you were a grown man and you knew it was bear country and you knew the way back out like you knew the way in and you had your chance to take it
but no
you had to crawl into the den and lay down by the bear
and whether you did or didnt know the bear was in it dont make any difference so if you got back out of that den without even a claw mark on you i would not only be unreasonable id be a damned fool
after all id like a little peace and quiet and freedom myself now i got a chance for it
she s got you fil us and you know it
you run a hard race and you run a good one but you s kun the hen house one time too many
yes uncle buck said
he drew his breath in and let it out again slow and not loud
but you could hear it
well he said
so i reckon ill have to take the chance then
you already took it mr hubert said
you did that when you came back here
then he stopped too
then he batted his eyes but only about six times
then he stopped and looked at uncle buck for more than a minute
what chance
he said
that five hundred dollars uncle buck said
what five hundred dollars
mr hubert said
he and uncle buck looked at each other
now it was mr mr hubert that batted his eyes again and then stopped id like to ask you about quentin his father
i think many readers get the impression that quentin is the way he is to a large extent because of his fathers lack of values or the fact that he doesnt seem to pass down to his son many values that will sustain him
do you think that quentin winds up the way he does primarily because of that or are we meant to see would you say that the action comes primarily from what he is just abetted by what he gets from his father
when for a time you left that area togo to france in a fable it must ve appeared perhaps that it was a different aspect to this fundamental truth that you were do they exist just in memory now
ill buy the damn girl then and well call the rest of this foolishness off
hahm r hubert said again
this is the most serious foolishness you ever took part in in your life
no you said you wanted your chance and now you ve got it
here it is right here on the table waiting on you
so uncle buck shuffled the cards and mr hubert cut them then he took up the deck and dealt in turn until uncle buck and mr hubert had five
and uncle buck looked a this hand along time and then said two cards and he gave them to him and mr hubert looked a this hand quick and said one card and he gave it to him and mr hubert flipped his discard on to the two which uncle buck had discarded and slid the new card into his hand and opened it out and looked at it quick again and closed it and looked at uncle buck and said well
did you help them three s
no uncle buck said
well i did mr hubert said
he shot his hand across the table so the cards fell face up in front of uncle buck and they were three kings and two fives and said by god buck m cc asl in you have met your match at last
and that was all
uncle buddy said
it was late then near sunset they would beat mr hubert s in another fifteen minutes
yes sir he said telling that too how uncle buck waked him at daylight and he climbed out a window and got the pony and left and how uncle buck said that if they pushed him too close in the meantime he would climb down the gutter too and hide in the woods until uncle buddy arrived
hah uncle uncle buddy said
was to mey st url there
yes sir he said
he was waiting in the stable when i got the pony
he said a in t they settled it yet
and what did you say
uncle buddy said
i said uncle buck looks like he s settled
but uncle buddy a in t go there yet
hah uncle buck uncle buddy said
and that was about all
they reached the house
maybe uncle buck was watching them but if he was he never showed himself never came out of the woods
so miss soph on sib a was nowhere insight either so atleast uncle buck didnt give had nt quite given up atleast he hadn tasked her yet and he and uncle buddy and mr hubert ate supper and they came in from the kitchen and cleared the table leaving only the lamp on it and the deck of cards
then it was just like last night except that uncle buddy had no necktie and mr hubert wore the clothes now instead of a nightshirt and it was a shaded lamp on the table instead of a candle and mr hubert sitting a this end of the table with the deck in his hands riffling the edges with his thumb and looking at uncle buddy
then he tapped the edges even and set the deck out in the middle of the table under the lamp and folded his arms on the edge of the table and leaned forward a little on the table looking at uncle buddy who was sitting a this end of the table with his hands in his la pallone gray color like an old gray rock or a stump with gray moss on it that still with his round whitehead like uncle bucks but he didnt blink like uncle buck and he was a little thicker than uncle buck as if from sitting down so much watching food cook as if the things he cooked had made him a little thicker than he would have been and the things he cooked with and the flour and such had made him all one same quiet color
little toddy before west art
mr hubert said
i dont drink uncle buddy said
that s right mr hubert said
i knew there was something else besides just being woman weak that makes fil us seem human but no matter
he batted his eyes twice at uncle buddy
buck m cc asl in against the land and niggers you have heard me promise as soph on sib as dowry on the days he marries
if i beat you fil us marries sib bey without any dowry
if you beat me you get fil us
but i still get the three hundred dollars fil us owes me for ten nie
is that correct
that s correct uncle buddy said
stud mr hubert said
one hand
you to shuffle me to cut this boy to deal
no uncle buddy said
not cass
he s too young
i dont want him mixed up in any gambling
hahm r hubert said
its said that a man playing cards with a mode usmc cas lina in t gambling
but no matter
he was still looking at uncle buddy he never even turned his head when he spoke goto the backdoor and holler
bring the first creature that answers animal mule or human that can deal ten cards
so he went to the backdoor
but he didnt even need to call because to mey st url was squatting against the wall just outside the door and they returned to the drawing room where mr hubert stills at with his arms folded on his side of the table and uncle buddy s at with his hands in his lap on his side and the deck of cards facedown under the lamp between them
neither of them even looked up when he and to mey st url entered
shuffle mr hubert said
uncle buddy shuffled and set the cards back under the lamp and put his hands back in his lap and mr hubert cut the deck and folded his arms back on to the table edge
deal he said
still neither he nor uncle buddy looked up
they just s at there while while to mey st urls saddle colored hands came into the light and took up the deck and dealt one card facedown to mr hubert and one facedown to uncle buddy and one face up to mr hubert and it was a king and one face up to uncle buddy and it was a six
buck m cc asl in against sib bey s dowry mr hubert said
deal
and the hand dealt mr hubert a card and it was a three and uncle buddy a card and it was a two
mr hubert looked at uncle buddy
uncle buddy rapped once with his knuckles on the table
deal mr hubert said
and the hand dealt mr hubert a card and it was another three and uncle buddy a card and it was a four
mr hubert looked at uncle buddy s cards
then he looked at uncle buddy and uncle buddy rapped on the table again with his knuckles
deal mr hubert said and the hand dealt him an ace and uncle buddy a five and now mr hubert just s at still
he didnt look at anything or move for a whole minute he just s at there and watched uncle buddy put one hand on to the table for the first time since he shuffled and pinch up one corner of his facedown card and look at it and and then put his hand back into his lap
check mr hubert said
ill bet you them two niggers uncle buck buddy said
he didnt move either
he just s at just like he satin the wagon or on a horse or in the rocking chair he cooked from
against what
mr hubert said
against the three hundred dollars theophilus owes you for ten nie and the three hundred you and theophilus agreed on for to mey st url uncle buddy said
hahm r hubert said only it wasnt loud at all this time not even short
then he said hah
hah hah and not loud either
then he said well
then he said well well
then he said well checkup for a minute
if i win you takes ib bey without a dowry and the two niggers an did on to we fil us anything
if you win theophilus is free uncle buddy said
and you owe him the three hundred dollars for to mey st url
that s just if i call you mr hubert said
if i dont call you fil us won to we me nothing and i won to we fil us nothing unless i take that nigger which i have been trying to explain to you and him both for years i wont have on my place
we will be right back where all this foolishness started from except for that
so what it comes down to is i either got to give a nigger away or risk buying one that you done already admitted you cant keep at home
then he stopped talking
for about a minute it was like he and uncle buddy had both gone to sleep
the nmr hubert picked up his facedown card and turned it over
it was another three and mr hubert s at there without looking at anything at all his fingers beating a tattoos low and steady and not very loudon the table
hm he said
and you need a trey and there a in t but four of the mandi already got three
and you just shuffled
and i cut afterward
and if i call you i will have to buy that nigger
who dealt these cards a mode us
only he didnt wait to be answered
he reached out and tilted the lampshade the light moving up to mey st urls arms that were supposed to be black but were not quite white up his sunday shirt that was supposed to be white but wasnt quite either that he put on everytime her an away just as uncle buck put on the necktie each time he went to bring him back and on to his face and mr hubert s at there holding the lampshade and looking at to mey st url
then he tilted the shade back down and took up his cards and turned them facedown and pushed them across the middle of the table
ipass a mode us he said
he was still too worn out for sleep to s it on a horse so this time he and uncle buddy and ten nie all three rode in the wagon while to mey st url led the pony from old jake
and when they got home just after daylight this time uncle buddy never even had time to get breakfast started and the fox never even got out of the crate because the dogs were right there in the room
old moses went right into the crate with the fox so that both of them went right right on out through the backend of it
that is the fox went through because when uncle buddy opened the door to come in old moses was still wearing most of the crate around his neck until uncle buddy kicked it off him
so they made just one run across the front gallery and around the house and they could hear the fox s claws when when he went scrabbling up the lean pole on to the roof a fine race while it lasted but but the tree was too quick
what in damn shell do you mean uncle buddy said casting that damn thing with the dogs right in the same room
damn the fox uncle buck said
goon and start breakfast
it seems to mei ve been away from home a whole damn month
lets give mr faulkner and mr faulkner s voice a moments rest and and he has told me that hell be glad to have questions
and so well take about a five minute break and then have a question period i think mr faulkner will be very interested to see what questions you might have to ask him so go right ahead and volunteer
are you playing a kind of fugue on the theme of races here
are you having a lot of fun with that
i had a lot of fun with it
i wasnt playing a fugue on the theme of races
i was writing about people in what i what tome was amusing terms and i hoped it would be amusing terms to the reader
no it was primarily about people about people who had got into a predicament and solved it with the only tools they had
this is a little bit off the theme of literature but id like to if you wouldnt mind tellus a little about your trip to greece
i think i would like to hear a little about that if that s not getting too far off the subject too faraway from it
it was a strange experience in that that was the only country that looked exactly like we had i mean the background the educational background of of the anglo saxon had taught him to expect it to look
and sure enough there was the hellenic light that i had heard of had read about
and is a who mer swine dark sea too
and there was a the only place i was in where there was a sense of a very distant past but there was nothing inimical in it in the other parts of of the old world theresa sense of of the past but there is something something gothic gothic and in a sense a little terrifying
in greece the people seem to function against that past that for all its its remoteness in time it was still inherent in the the light the resurgence of spring
you didnt expect to see the ghost of of the old greeks or expect to see the actual figures of the gods but you had a sense that they they were near and they were still powerful not inimical just just powerful
that they themselves had had reached and were enjoying a kind of a nirvana
they existed but they were free of of mans folly and trouble of having to involve themselves in mans problem
that they were at last had the time to watch what man did without having to be involved in it
yes it was very interesting
i think that two weeks is not only too short its an insult to that country that one should go with with no limit to his visit
that there s no end to what you can see and then sure enough you see something which is exactly like what you imagined
there will be the plain and and across it suddenly there is parnassus with snow on it and the old ruins they look ancient but theresa sense as though it happened only yesterday
that whether agamemnon ever lived ever was an actual manor not there he was he because he had to be
it was necessary
that he he was in the literary history of mans spirit so therefore he must have existed at one time as a flesh and blood man
in your new book the town you have fl ems nope s assuming the mask of respectability
and i was wondering since you i think are going to write a trilogy that i was wondering what type of character would fl ems nope s assume say in your next book
he had never heard of respectability
he didnt even know it existed until suddenly he found that he needed it
and so he assumed it and as soon as he doesnt need respectability any longer he will cast it away
that he had a certain aim which he intended to attain
he would use whatever tools necessary with complete ruthlessness to gain that end
and if he had to use respectability he would use that
if he had to use religious observance he would use that
if he has to destroy his wife he will do that
if he has to trick a a child a girl child into being his tool he will do that with no compunction whatever
that respectability to him was just a tool mr
faulkner may i ask to what extent when you re composing your stories are your characters do they represent ideas or a theme consciously on your part or to what extent are they just people who keep developing as characters and let theme and plot fall where they may
yes the character comes first as people
i didnt have enough formal education to know really what ideas are that ideas tome must be translated into the human being struggling against his own problems
the ideas are only incidental or maybe coincidental to writing about people and the ideas of the symbolism they are simply in my own case the tools which the craftsman uses to tell the story but his interest is primarily in the characters not in the plot not really so much in what they do but its in in making the the figure of his imagination assume three dimensions and stand on its own feet and cast its own shadow
the symbolism the style the ideas are only coincidental to that and are simply the tools which the craftsman uses but would would you say then sir that you have to you would begin with an idea for a character rather than an anecdote or an idea
well of an event
it could bean anecdote or a scene but it would be not an idea
it would be people in motion people in some tragic or comic situation struggling to get out of it or it could become the first conception would be the character itself for example this story you read us this evening do you recall this is probably so far back i wondered though what was the germ of that story
do you recall it perhaps
the germ of the story was one of the three oldest ideas that man can write about which is love sex
and tome it was comic of the man that had got himself involved in an engagement and he himself couldnt extricate himself and his he had to call on his brother and his brother used the only tools he had which was his ability to play poker which tome what was funny
it was funny
also it was it had a certain sociological importance into show my country as it really was in those days
the the elegance of the colonial plantation didnt exist in my country
my country was still frontier
the plantation the the columned porticos that was charleston and nat che z
but in my country it was still frontier
people lived from day today with a with a bluff and crude hardiness but with a certain simplicity which tome is very interesting because the common picture of the south is all magnolias and crinoline and and grecian portals and things like that which was true only around the fringes of the south not in the interior the backwoods
to what extent have you drawn directly on experience for these stories
that s difficult to say
the writer i think has three reservoirs one is experience which includes what he has read
the other is observation which of course is what he has seen and done
the third is imagination and he himself doesnt know and in fact he has nt gotten time to be concerned or to care how much of which he draws on at anyone time
its as though he had three reservoirs with three pipes that goto a common tap with maybe an automatic selector somewhere that when when observation doesnt go far enough it tries experience
when experience has nt gone far enough it reverts to imagination that the only check is some rigid concept of what is truth and what is not truth in in the craftsman which what he does has got to match
if it doesnt match he throws it away and then he s got togo back to imagination
if that is not enough then he s got to increase his experience or his observation
but no man can say just how much of of each he uses
he knows any writer that he is going to change and alter anything he writes because any fiction writer is a congenital liar to begin with you see
he is not going to take anything as is
he s going to change it
have you enjoyed your stay here at the university
yes sir very much we were interested in your comment of of coming to virginia because you liked snobs i wonder if you might care to well that was i thought that we were more or less informal then and i didnt really mean that as a serious observation
but now let me define what i mean by as nobis someone who is so complete in himself and so satisfied with what he has that he needs nothing from anybody
that when a stranger comes up he can accept that stranger on the strangers terms provided only the stranger observe only a few amenities of civilization and tome that s what the people what virginians do
they dont they never push at me
they want nothing of me
they they will will offer me their ho spit ability and they will will accept me
all i have to do is just to behave decently
sir is there anyone incident in your life that you just decided then that you were going to become a writer
i was living in new orleans
i was running a powerboat for a bootlegger
i would go down and take the boat with a a man with a gun and a a negro hand for the crew through the industrial canal across the mississippi sound to an island where the schooner would bring the raw alcohol up from the indies and we would load the cargo and bring it back to town
id get a hundred dollars for each trip and in those days that was a lot of money so i wouldnt have to work until i began to run out of money
then i would make another run with the boat and i met sherwood anderson and i liked him at once
we would meet and walk around the french quarter and he would talk and i would listen
we would meet again in the evening
wed goto some pleasant courtyard and weds it over a bottle of whiskey and he would talk and i would listen
in the morning she would be in seclusion working that went on day after day and i thought if that s all you had to do to be a writer then that was the life for meso i decided i wanted to become a writer and i started a book and right away i found it was fun to do and i had nt seen mr anderson in weeks
i met mrs anderson on the street and she said we have nt seen you
i said yes mim writing a book
she said good god
is a wher again a few weeks later
she said it old anderson sherwood you were writing a book
she says doi want him mr
anderson to read it
i said well m he can if he wants to
she said well he told me to tell you hell make a trade with you if he dont have to read that manuscript hell tell his publisher to take it
so i said done
and i finished the manuscript and he told his publisher to take it and that show i got to be a professional writer but of course by that time id found that writing was fun
it was was the most fun id found yet and i knew then that i had been bitten and was incurable
i was wondering how long you can write for how long at a stretch can you write before you feel tired before you ve tired yourself out
you get tired i think before you realize it
i took a leaf from from gentlemen prefer blondes when she says always leave him while you re looking good
well i always try to remind myself to stop before im have found out im tired but as long as it shot its its difficult to break off and and quit
that takes a certain amount of discipline to stop and always leave something fresh to start on tomorrow
that s the only rule about writing i have is never to write completely out at one stretch
that could bean hour or sixteen hours in a day though there re some workmen that have to have a rigid discipline
they s it so many hours a day whether they write anything or not
they do research
they have notebooks and they they take a piece of paper and and plot a graph for the story to follow which ive never done because im lazy and i dont like the effort of putting the words on the paper so i put that on put that off as long as possible and a great deal of that is done here before i start to write
did you have a question
i have a question ive always wanted to ask an author is do they really put all the significance and meaning and trying to teach this big lesson in the book and i had thought that you answered it once but then you seem to contradict yourself
do you write to try to teach somebody a lesson to describe your state or just because you think you ve got to write a good story and make some money off of it
nono
all that is incidental
what the writer is is doing is trying to create people
he has nt got time to bother with the symbols and the message the first rate writer has nt
he is busy creating people and he would do that even if he had to pay for the privilege
he s not interested in the money
the money is incidental tooth a the is having a goodtime creating living people and that s motive enough to write a book
uh yes i think so
actually he she s demon driven
the the writer who is trying to tell a message is not primarily a writer
he is he s more of an an evangelist or a propagandist maybe
but but the writer the true fiction eeri s interested only in creating human beings then could i ask you what ike s nope s is supposed to be in in the hamlet
what were you creating then
is he someone like whom like someone whom you knew or what in ono
no writer is satisfied with with the folks that god create she s convinced that he can do much better than that to mei kes nope s was simply an interesting human being with with mans natural normal failings his the baseness which man fights against the honor which he hopes that he can always match
the honesty the courage which he hopes that he can always match
and at time she fails
and then he is he is pitiable
but he s still human and he still believes that man can be better than he is and that is what the writer is trying to do is interested into showman as he is in conflict with his problems with his nature with his own heart with his fellows and with his environment
that s all i in my opinion any book or story is about
of course it has mutations
the problems fall into the categories of money or sex or death but the basic story is man in conflict with his own heart with his fellows or with his environment
is there any special reason why you consider wolfe such a great author
that was an unfortunate remark i made about twenty years ago that ive been explaining ever since it was at a group meeting something like this
someone asked me how i rated my contemporaries
i said its too soon to rate us we have nt finished yet
he said well you have nt you any opinion at all about them
i said about who
he named wolfe dos passos caldwell and hemingway
i said well and this was sort of off the cuff
in ever thought of it before
i said well i think we all failed and so i would rate them on the splendor of the failure
i put wolfe first because he made the the most splendid failure
i put myself second
i put dos passos third caldwell fourth and hemingway fifth it had nothing to do with the value of the work wed done but on the on the splendor with which we had failed
i put hemingway last because he had found quickly a method in which he was secure and he didnt need to splash around to experiment that he stuck to that and he didnt didnt need to try to put all the history of mans heart on to one pinhead and one paragraph which wolfe had tried to do which is why wolfe s material would have been unreadable had it not been for his editor mr maxwell perkins at s crib ner s and mr perkins in in away really wrote wolfe s book because the mass of incoherent material that which wolfe sent to him would ve been unreadable if it had nt been for mr perkins
sir you say that your characters are and as much as possible anyway just people
and yeti sort of got the idea that fl ems nope s is sort of a practically in human character and sort of symbolic himself
does that ever did that enter when you wrote that orwell it would depend on what he is symbolic of
you see people who are in human people
i think that i didnt invent an in human the in human type which which fl em is a manifestation of
i think that jason comp son in another book of mine is completely in human
but in away he is i hope a living man
i have known people in actual life who were hopeless who in in the terms of of of the humanities in the terms of of the of the verities of of mans condition compassion and pity and courage unselfishness he was in human but he was still a living man
he was not created to be a symbol of anything
he was simply created because suddenly he had a place in in that particular scene that i was writing about in that particular problem of human beings that i was writing about
not to symbolize anything at all
sir do you believe that the theory of absurdity is applicable to man himself
i doubt if i understand you
you ll have to explain a little more what you mean by that well the theory of absurdity implies that man is completely unintelligent
he its absurd for him to ever oh i see putting myself on the plane of being or to come in contact with god or anything like that
noi dont
that would take a different mentality from mine to accept man as absurd
he is ridiculous at times
he is he is nothing consistently absurd except these these exceptions we spoke of who are in human and who are are are devils but in general man is capable of of absurdity just ashes capable of grandeur but he is not consistently capable of any
my belief is that he wants to be consistently capable always of of the best things of of of grandeur of courage of compassion of honesty but he fails but but tome he s not absurd its only in his ephemeral manifestation of the moment
i would say as as as an idea someone with the capacity to read english that appeared suddenly with no past mature out of a vacuum would get nothing from reading the books that he would have to have something in his own experience of of man and mans condition and mans behavior to have made the books comprehensible to him so of course he reads into the books things the writer didnt put in there in the terms that his and the writers experience could not possibly be identical
that there are things the writer might think is in that book which the reader doesnt find for the same reason that no two experiences can be identical but everyone reads according to his own own lights his own experience his own observation imagination and experience
most of us here tonight i think are rather young men in in the field of engineering
a lot of us hope to begetting out this year
i wonder if you have this maybe an offbeat question i wonder if you have any advice to young men getting ready togo out in the light you might say from the point of view of someone who s studied human beings and people as much as you have
there was a very wiseman said tome once in ever give anybody advice because they might take it
and at first i didnt understand what he meant by that but but no within kido actually nobody can bathe for you you know
you ve got to do that yourself and the experience the advice you get i think is not by asking for it
you you get that through some form of osmosis
you will get it from the books you read from your experiences in college
everyman has got to stand on his own feet and i think now that i wouldnt accept anyone s advice that i would rather make my own mistakes than to accept advice which which might save me because i know now that mistakes dont hurt you well that s good advice in itself i think
well thankyou sir if you were to undertake a biography what characteristics would you consider
i wouldnt undertake one for the reason i just stated before that any writer worth his salt is convinced he can improve on anything that god ever made i would never write my own because i know being a congenital liar in ever could tell the truth about things
sir if you were to write a book based around the university here what sort of characters and situations would you put in it
now that question in away has been answered before
the writing i have done has always been from the character
now if the character that i thought of said im going togo to the university of virginia then i would have to write about the university of virginia but the character would have to command that i write about the university of virginia
its its not in in my line of work to say now im going to write a story about anyplace and then put people into it that the people themselves say come on here faulkner were going to write this one about the university of virginia
i someone who talked to you gave a list of virtues
ive heard you mention some of them tonight
do you have that ready i think that courage and honesty were among your list of virtues
well lets use a little better word tome than virtues they re the verities of the human heart
they are courage honor pride compassion pity
that they are they are not virtues
one doesnt try to practice them in my opinion simply because they are good
one practices tries to practice them simply because they are the edifice on which the whole history of man has been founded and by means of which his as a race he has endured this long
that without without those verities he would have vanished just like the mastodon and the other ephemeral phenomena of nature which have come and gone in the history of the world
man has endured despite his frailty because he accepts and believes in those verities that one must be honest not because its its its virtuous but because that s the only way to get along
that if people lied constantly to one another you would never know where you were you would never know what was going on
that if people didnt practice compassion there would be nothing to defend the weak until they got enough strength to stand for themselves
if one didnt practice something of of pride one would have nothing to be proud about to have said i did well i did nothing that i was ashamed of
i can lie down with myself and sleep
that is they are they are the verities to be practiced not because they area virtue but because that s the best way to live in peace with yourself and your fellows
sir what is a roan tooth
oh it was a probably a dead tooth that had turned a bluish color which to this little boy was the color of roan horse
that was the first color he thought of that it was a dead tooth in this lady s mouth here that had a bluish castor purplish cast to it well lets have one more question for mr faulkner and then well close down for the night
yes aska question
in some of your books i have noticed the characters tend to be sort of blanks
you dont know what they are
a good example of this is s ut pen in ab salom ab salom
he s a blank until the end of the book you dont know what motivates him
you see him motivated you see him doing these things but you dont see what motivates him
do you start with knowing what the character is and describe his motivations describe his actions and then get around to describing what motivates the actions
no it is the writers fault
before the writer begins to put that character down he has got to understand him and if he has nt made perfectly plain and coherent the motivations necessary to make that character real to the reader then the writer himself is at fault he has nt probably learned enough of his craft by that time but to the writer of course that character is intact and whole and is breathing and is standing up and if to the reader he doesnt stand up and is not real and actual then that is the fault of the craftsman i didnt say he s real and actual and i realize this but i dont see the reasons for his actions until the until the very end of the book
i just didnt see why he did these things
i see that he did the mandi knew there was a reason for it but i didnt know what it was
well you can meet an actual living creature orman you can see him in the throes of some action and it wont be until after the action is complete that you ll find out why he did that
you agree to that that that s possible yeah
well that s the case of s ut pen
its simply was a matter of of of where you happened to be standing where the reader happened to be standing that he didnt the observer happened to be standing that he didnt see the motives in time
now that can be used as as a trick to be more effective
i dont remember if that was my intent then but that is a valid trick which which applies one of the simple primary rules of of writing any paragraph which is emphasis
i was wondering you said that in your list of the five authors you thought you had all failed and i wondered just what it was you thought you had failed at and what you thought if there is such a thing as success
oh i time an by it this that what saves any artist any writer is that he will never quite attain the image the shape the dream
its always out of his reach
if he ever attained it then he would be miserable for the rest of his life but he never quite matches that so he writes again and again and again and that s that s why the artists life is such a happy one
he never does reach satiety
he never will
he will believe that next time he will write the thing that will match that marvelous dream that he has but but he know she wont
but he will still try
there s always some reason for him to wake up tomorrow morning
there s something to do
that s why he s the happiest man of all of them and do you think that each new book is better than the old one
well tome there reno degrees
its either good or its its bad and its got to be perfect then ill say its good but there are not degrees of it the only consistent opinion i have is that its another failure neither good nor bad it just it just a failure
but never a shameful failure its its when the book was basely conceived and executed it failed
that s the shameful failure
that is something to writhe over but just a decent honest failure is all right because as i just said failure and mistakes never hurt you
nothing to dread or fear or or dodge is an opportunity in which you might make a mistake
there s nothing to be ashamed of in that nothing to hurt you well ladies and gentleman thankyou for your interesting and intelligent questions thankyou mr faulkner
noi dont because i mim not very literary and dont keep up with things like that
somebody said that southerners dont read books they write books
maybe that s all it is but i cant say unless it maybe that until the last war southerners never got away from home
their only chance to adventure was in the imagination
their only chance for for change for an experience that was romantic and and interesting was to invent it and put it down on paper
im not too certain that i believe that very much myself but that s the sort of thing
not necessarily
i think that scott was read more in the south for the reason that at a time the southerner had very little of his money to devote to the buying of books and there was a kinship perhaps between the life of of of of scotts highland and the life the southerner led after reconstruction
they too were were in the aftermath of a of a land which had been conquered and devastated by people people speaking its own language which has nt happened too many times
and so every southern household when they bought books they they bought scott
i reckon it was because you got more words for your money maybe could have had something to do with that but every household that all that at all pretended to be literate had scott that s true
i dont know
it seems tome that very few southerners were apart of that group of expatriates of the twenties in paris
most of the one sik new were were northerners
i dont remember a single southerner that had any part in it
i would say that the reasons for the renaissance in southern writing was in the cards in the making long before that
i think this may have had a little to do with it since the civil war there has been a great deal of misunderstanding is not quite the right word the northerner the out lander had a queer and erroneous idea of of what southern people were
it maybe that that was an instinctive desire in southerners to tell the out lander just what we were just what we might have had that we felt was worth accepting four years of war in which we knew we had no chance to win it to say this is what we had that we thought was worth that or this is what we actually are
i dont know
that that s probably valid
i imagine there are so manythings that went into it that probably nobody could say this is where the resurgence of writing in the south came from
i myself am inclined to think it was because of the the barrenness of the southerners life that he had to resort to his own imagination to create his own carcassonne in that connection would you mind commenting on this question
you you said a minute ago facetiously that southerners dont read books they write them
it has long been known of course to literary historians that southern writers both before and after the civil war counted pretty largely on northern readers
and hayne for example was a notable example
lanier is another example
do you suppose that has been in the consciousness of the average southern writer and could possibly have influenced his work in anyway
yes it has
its in his consciousness that the man that will publish his book is a northerner and he he is never unaware of that that the publisher and and to an extent his readers are northerners
i think that most southerners know that his home folk saint going to like what he writes anyway that he s not really writing to them and that and that they simply do not read books
they are good people but they just do not read books the clash between the explanations of the south does that help square the fact that the explanations offered are not always greeted with warmth in the south itself
can i have your specific question again
i got two or three different ideas there what i meant was that if part of the renascence in southern writers is due to an urge to explain the southern the south to explain itself is it not also true that once one gets out of the moonlight and magnolias school that various of the non writing southerners do not like what the writing southerners door the picture they present
yes that s quite true
the the non writing southerner the non reading southerner he wants the sort of brochure that the chamber of commerce gets out there are things in his country that he s not too proud of himself but but to him its bad manners to show that in public
the an element of the locality but didnt the people of his own country have a sort of a fierce pride in people like thoreau and emerson
or was that just the educated intellectual new englander that felt that
well i always thought that everybody they might not have approved so much of all that emerson or thoreau said but they had a a fierce almost provincial pride in you d have togo to hawthorne wouldnt you to find would that have held true of hawthorne
anyway as far as that s concerned as far as i know he was just as popular at home as he was anywhere else
well that gets back to something else
can a man write about ideas except in in the provincial terms of his background
could emerson have written emerson would it have been the same emerson if he d been a mississippian say or a texan or a californian
but would a californian in a climate that dont change where you dont need even a warm house to live in what would he care about self reliance
well i would say that carlyle s and whitman s definition of a big man were completely different carlyle san islander a small country
his idea of a big manisa is a big individual man
i should think that whitman side a of a big man is one that is lucky enough to belong to a race of giants that he s one too
i wonder if whitman believed that he was a big german than anybody else in america
it would have to just like the language the man knows to write in would have some influence on him
but i dont think that the that the topography one topography will produce a writer where another topography wont
but of course no sir because because the lack of the lack of roads inyo k napa taw pha county a in t near as complex as as madison avenue or nd street
though of course that depends upon who is looking at each one yo k napa taw pha county a in t near as complex as the empire state building
well a mans future is inherent in that man
i in the sense that life ad is not the end of life that there ll be a
that we assume that
there may not be but we assume that
and in man in mans behavior today is
if we just had a machine that could project ahead and could capture that that machine could could isolate and and freeze a picture animage of what man will be doing in just as as the machine might capture and fix the light rays showing what he was doing in in bc

that is that s the mystical belief that there is no such thing as was
that that time is and if there s no such thing as was then there is no such thing as will be
that time is a is a not a fixed condition that time is in away in away the sum of the combined intelligence s of all men who breathe at that moment
nowell i can assume the fact that in the people which i create is the genesis the seed of
i dont know it and i dont think i need to know it
but the people behave according to the the pattern by which man has been able to endure this long
then if he holds to that pattern he will continue to endure assuming that there s not some some tremendous cataclysmic explosion which will wreck everything
that the verities which are true now will be true in and man will will go through the same struggle to live up to them to behave as he he wants to behave whether he can or not whether he fails or not
that his problems really wont be any different the important problems wont be any different in than they are now
oh i see what you mean
well of course the writer arrogates to himself that right to know the future of his own people
he dont know the future of the human race but he does know the future of of of that individual that character or he never could get his book done
that is he has got to know where the things going in away before he starts because then he wont know when to stop it
yes yes
yes yes
i think so
i think if we could know the future of ourselves and one another we would never be as baffled and confused by by people by our contact with people as we are
it wouldnt be as much fun of course but let me figure away to phrase it and get it clear in my mind in so long
i dont know well what what do you think is the was the difference in quality of the impact on the to the southern people after the civil war and the as a mental experience and though and say worldwar i the people that were involved in worldwar i
i would say possibly it was sharper a harder experience because for for years the southerner had lived a safe and isolated life in which nothing actually had happened to him except the simple things of of crop failures and and trouble with with his own particular plantation economy
the civil war was a great deal of a shock to him because suddenly it thrust him into the world
he had to become a member not of a class or of a provincial segment but a member of the whole human race
when he got into the second worldwar he had gotten used to having to be a member of the human race whether he wanted to or not and so that wasnt as much shock
also if anybody did he won that war
that is he was on the side that was succesful
in the civil war the southerner was on the side that lost i suppose my question in reference to dostoevsky boils down to this
why do you consider ben jy a good tool in the telling of this story one of the instruments in telling the story
the same question why do you often use children who are quite young and not much of a the one in var daman
is it possibly because the idiot and the child are free of any preconceived ideas about the truth
they have no convention
they have nt had any religion to fog them or anything like that
they resort of open minded and free
and are they better judges of the truth
can they see the truth better than the more sophisticated and more intelligent human beings
only in this sense say there was a mirror which would obliterate everything from the image it reflected except except the verities
tome that is the child
as you say it has less trash that it it has had to assimilate and live within order to cope with the adult world
it it sees with a not a clearer eye that s not the word i want but it it is incapable of seeing the things which are which are not true which dont match the verities which the adult has been trained and had to learn so that he no longer knows that he what he sees is obfuscated
the child dont even know that it doesnt see something that the adult sees
and what the child sees is closer to the verities the important things
i think that s the most interesting thing to write about is the child as it learns to cope with the adult world which it didnt create that its got to learn to live within order to endure to get along to have enough to eat and how it makes those adjustment show it gradually comes to believe that that lies are truths
it it dont know that it is coming to believe that
it just has to learn that or die
and when its still a child it doesnt know yet
it has nt had to believe that lies are truth
to the child the lie is still a lie and the truth is truth
ben jy the idiot he was a sublimated idiot probably but he had some of that quality
he had the childs quality to see and recognize only the truth but he had a mans long years of of simple experience whether he could assimilate that experience or not
he had a longer time to see that more human beings were capable of believing that lies were true than the child of three or four or five or six
well that savagery that ruthlessness that s one of the verities
its not a virtue but it its a verity
tome there s theresa distinction between verity and virtue
some of the verities when they are practiced the practice of them becomes virtue
the child is incapable of being clubbed up by your shibboleth you mus nt do this because its wrong
the child says i will do this because i want to and he tries to do it
that in that that s a truth in in the world too that man can be in human to man
its a verity
its its a vice when practiced but its one of the verities
just like like honor and honesty
that s was simply a well i dont like the word trick but it was used deliberately to look at at the object from three points of view
just as when you you examine a monument you will walk around it
you are not satisfied to look at it from just one side
also it to look at it from from three different mentalities
that was one was the mirror which obliterated all except truth because the mirror didnt know the other factors existed
another was to look at it from the point of view of of someone who had made of himself a more or less artificial man through his desire to practice what he had been told was a virtue apart from his belief in virtues what he had been told trained by his respect for education in the old classical sense
the other was from the point of view of a man who who practiced virtue from simple instinct from from well more than that because for a practical reason because it was better
there was less confusion if all people didnt tell lies to one another and didnt pretend
that seemed tome to give a more complete picture of the specific incidents as they occurred if they could be expressed three times
well he changed
he grew up in that book
and of course his point of view changed
well he had got out of his depth depth
he had got into the real world
while he was could be a county attorney an amateur sherlock holmes then he was at home but but he got out of that
he got into a real world in which people anguished and suffered not simply did things which they shouldnt do
and he wasnt as prepared to cope with people who were following their own bent not for profit but simply because they had to
that is he knew a good deal less about people than he knew about the law and about the weighing of evidence and and drawing the right conclusions from what he he saw with his legal mind
when he when he had to deal with people he was an amateur
he was at time she had a good deal less judgment than his nephew did
which is not against education as probably the passion he had forgetting degrees for trying this and trying that and going all the way to europe to get more degrees to study more was in his own nature
it was the same character that made him shy away from marriage
he was probably afraid to be married he might get too involved with the human race if he married one of them did you mean gavin stevens to be like that in intruder in the dust
nom
these people i invent and after that i just run along and put down what they say and do
i dont know always what they are going to develop into myself i mean is gavin at the same stage of development in intruder in the dust
is he younger in the town
intruder in the dust happened after the town
intruder in the dust happened about or and the town began in in and went to probably stevens learned something from the town to carry into intruder in the dust
the fight that gavin has with de spain in the town reminded mein some ways of the fight that quentin had when he was in cambridge
they both seemed a little bit liked on quixote yes fighting for the honor of a lady
is there any such similarity there in character between the two menat that time
not hats that s a constant sad and and funny picture too
it is the knight that goes out to defend somebody who dont want to be defended and dont need it
but its a very fine quality in in human nature
i hope it will always endure
it is comical and a little sad and quentin and stevens were that much a like
what did you start within intruder in the dust
was it the idea of a single character or
well it began with the notion there was a tremendous flux of detective stories going about at that time and my children were always buying them and bringing them home
id stumble over them everywhere i went
and i thought of an idea for one would beaman in jail just about to be hung that would have to be his own detective
he couldnt get anybody to help him
then the next thought was the man for that would be a negro
then the character of of lucas lucas beauchamp came along
and the book came out of that
it was the notion of a man in jail who couldnt hire a detective couldnt hire one of these tough guys that slapped women around and took a drink everytime he couldnt think of what to say next but once i thought of beauchamp then he took charge of the story and the story was a good deal different from the idea that of the detective story that i had started with sir speaking of technique and the way characters are handled somebody s accused you of going to school to joyce
would you mind commenting on his and perhaps any other individual influences on you
i dont believe that any any writer has time togo to school to anyone man
he learn learns from everything he reads
he steals from any source that s available
he has no morals whatever
but he i dont think he ever sets out to say now im going to write like joyce or write like anybody else that he s too busy writing about people
here members everything he reads without having to memorize
he is he is voracious and amoral
he stores away everything telephone directories up and down
congressional record i used to read that
and the time comes when he needs something and sure enough there it is
he dont remember where he got it and dont care because he is perfectly willing for anyone after him to take anything from his work atleast i a mim quite sure that everything i ever read has influenced me
noi dont
ive said this before
that s one good thing about writing
when you write a book you dont ever have to read it again because you re busy on another one
and i think the writer never goes back to see where he got what from
im sure he could find plenty of sources but he he dont do it because he s busy with another one then
i imagine if i went back over the work i could find similarities
i can find similarities between conrad and hardy
and im sure i can find conrad in my stuff and find almost anybody else you could name
im inclined to think that all writers do that only most of them except conrad and me maybe a little more clever about it
probably conrad was because he deliberately taught himself a foreign language to write in
and mine maybe because in ever never went to school enough to save myself the shortcuts of learning english
that we both area little more obvious than the others for that reason sir some months ago you expressed a fear in the loss of frontiers in american writing
do you see any new frontiers opening up
well not exactly a frontier i think now that we are faced with more of a of a threat
it could hardly be a frontier to be conquered
its its a force to be resisted the force that is the pressure to make everybody belong to a mass or a group which in my opinion would be the death of the writing and the painting and the music and everything else that man has got to resist that
its difficult to resist because to a certain extent he has got to compromise now simply in order to get along
its the you ve got to be on the alert constantly to know just exactly where to draw the line which is too bad for the artist who should have all his time free to fight simpler dragons than that
no that would belong to the same belief that it i have never quite done it yet that it fails in all respects that it has nt has nt shown the future it has nt been a good enough picture of the past
its not a good enough picture of of now is to please me
i cant say because i have nt quite got up to yet
its that san interesting thought and ill be curious to know if ido begin to run into trouble then
s of ari have nt got up to that yet
oh yes yes
now that comes back to a more or less idle remark i made years ago
i have no particular great admiration for wolfe
this is what happened in that
it was at a group years ago
somebody asked what i thought about my contemporaries
i said were not done writing yeti couldnt say
and he said well have nt you got any opinion at all about them
i said about who
he named wolfe dos passos erskine caldwell hemingway and me
i said well i willi would rate us this way which i did and that s what that came from and for about twenty years now ive been trying to explain that
i dont know because i haven tread much of wolfe
i have just glanced glanced into it
i think ive read one of his short stories but none of the books have i ever finished
i have opened them and read a little here and a little there but in ever have finished one so i just dont know
i would rather have as few facts as possible because i in my opinion the writer is writing about truth and and i think truth and facts have almost no relation to one another
they a in t very closely connected and i would rather have as few facts as possible and let observation and experience and imagination do the rest of it
i dont know if you as immune to facts asia mit dont matter
in view of the fact that those people asked you for ratings when the when the horserace had gotten maybe to the first quarter mark and were now perhaps halfway around the course would you feel inclined to make any revision in the order that you saw at that time
no because i made my estimate on the gallantry of the failure not on the on the on the successor the or the validity of of the work
its on the gallantry of the effort which failed
in my opinion my work has all failed
it it a in t quite good enough which is the only reason to write another one because writing really a in t any fun
i mean the mechanics of putting the stuff down on paper is no fun
i can think of too many other things id rather do
and i dont see any reason to change that no
after we have all written out and if there s time to look back at it then i could could make a private estimate of the work
but right no within kits too soon
of course wolfe is finished because he s dead but the others are not
caldwell seems to have written himself out years ago which has nothing to do with the value of of of the first books and i think that the first books gods little acre and the short stories that s enough for any man
he should be content with that but but knowing writers i know he s not just a sim not content with mine
i meant only that hemingway had sense enough to find a method which he could control and didnt need or or didnt have to wasnt driven by his private demon to waste himself in trying to dodo more than that
so he has done consistently probably the most solid work of all of us
but it wasnt the the splendid magnificent bust that wolfe made in trying to put the whole history of the human heart on the head of a pin you might say
no because i dont have much patience with facts and any writer is a congenital liar to begin with or he wouldnt take up writing and so i couldnt tell the truth even about history that s why ill never write a biography
i couldnt tell the truth about faulkner im sure about it
any writer tries to improve on what he sees
in his opinion the lord a in t near as good as he is at creating people
you said that hemingway developed a method he could control
what do you think what is your personal opinion of across the river and into the trees
i would say it was that he considered it a bad book
just like he considers to have and have not a bad book probably but then the man that wrote some of the stories in men without women and some of the early books he can afford to write a bad book whenever he wants to i think
miss hale will agree with that wont you do you still read any of the books that come out today like the books by herman wouk and writers like him
noi dont
i think that most writers as they get old read less and less
the books that i read now are the ones i read and liked when i was twenty one years old
i haven tread a new book unless it was specifically put in my hand in oh fifteen years there have been exceptions of course that i have read for some particular reason like that someone asked me to look at it ori picked it up by chance and read a page and found i liked it but i dont keep up with modern books anymore
when i was young i read everything but not anymore
all of balzac don quixote madame bovary salam m bothe temptation of saint anthony turgenev i wonder what became of him
he s not even writing anymore
is he dead
does anybody know
dostoevsky tolstoy most of dickens the old testament shakespeare i dont read as much poetry as i did once some of conrad
i reckon there s maybe fifty books that every five years i will read through again some for the story some for a character
one of my favorite people is mrs gam pig e the route very winter and read about her again
the nigger of the narcissus
haven tread that in years
not in years
falk
the end of the tether
what s the one about the young man that was given command of the lord jim
barque in
bangkok youth
youth
its a question of the writers confidence
i think that what every writer wanted to be is a poet
he failed and so the next is the short story
he failed and so all that remains is to is to write the novel
the poet can take the instance the single instant of mans anguish into four lines or fourteen lines
the short story writer cant do that but he can do it in a thousand words
the novelist cant do either and it takeshima hundred thousand words to do sir you you seemed from that to place a premium on conciseness yet your most brilliant successes seem to have been in the other direction
conciseness is the wrong word its a its a distillation
down to the to the to perfection
you ve got to use the clumsy language to communicate
its a distillation of of the anguish to its essence which the poet can do
the short story writer is not that good
he has got to take a little more space a little more of the clumsy mean tools of communication
the novelist has got to take still more
but any story can be told in one sentence
if it cant be told in one sentence you d better throw it away and think of one that can be
of course the ramifications devolve from that out of that but the story itself the moment of anguish or triumph can be distilled into one sentence and the poet does it in in the most moving and most memorable way
he has touched it with with a magic as though that anguish or that triumph had never occurred before
yes nobody can escape that of course
but i think any writer that brings you a manuscript to read you can save time by not reading that one because the ones that write the good one shaven t got time to bring it to you and say read this
they dont care whether you read it or not or whether you like it or not
they re the good ones yes indeed some of the books you ve done you ve done well to hush up these people
they reso full of information
they dont need anything from me
i had nt noticed it just like the nigger of the narcissus is very short
i probably had nt noticed that much either well you have mentioned some of the novels that you like most
is there any particular poetry that you think came closest to saying the truth in a few words
almost all of it
burns keats wordsworth now and then whitman ben johnson marlowe almost all of it la for gue goethe almost all of it
that s why people still read it why the names are still known
well few are good ones
i dont think that difficulty is the word
its its a combination of of of a demon and and and a fire that you have
difficult or ease has nothing to do with it
ii wish i did know exactly what it is that it takes to make a poet
i think that any writer is better off if he looks on himself as a poet
he s a failed poet
i agree with you
but to look on himself primarily as a poet
that he has has found mans history in its its mutations in the the instances in which it it becomes apparent his anguish his triumph his failures the whole passion of of breathing is so strong and so urgent that it it must be recorded
and if he is very fortunate he can can do it as the poets did it and if he s a little less fortunate he can do it as the short story writers do it as chekhov did it
if he is least fortunate he s got togo back to the clumsy method of of mark twain and dreiser yes we are
well thankyou
i think that nobody can say im going to use stream of consciousness as my method for writing
that s that s wrong
hedge tinto trouble
he must use that simply as a tool only when nothing else will do the work
its much better to show the character in familiar terms of of action of speech but sometimes that s not sufficient
then you have to use another tool just as at times the carpenter realizes that his familiar tool is not quite enough to do what he wants to do so he s got to stop and make something make a tool to use mr
faulkner the new york times spoke of your brooding concern for people
this were you born with that brooding concern for the human being or was that a vision adulthood approaches or when did this brooding concern happen
now i think that s a question you should ask the man who wrote the piece in the new york times i dont think i have any brooding concerns for people
i like people
there s no brooding concern about it you dont you dont feel that you have a brooding concern
i didnt know i had until this man told me but i think people are are something that one doesnt need to brood about
people are interesting
they are the most interesting diverting thing on earth its its fun to watch people and wonder why they do what they do not to brood over them
of course one has got to be concerned over mans condition because if man is to advance he must take cognizance of mans condition to improve it but you dont brood over it
you do something about it
when you see injustice you raise your voice and and state that this is this is bad i dont like it but you dont brood over it
sir why is it that most of your short stories and hunting stories are so clear and simple like the one you just read yet yet some of your novels that you think are your finest are you know have to be so mixed up psychologically in that they re hard for the average reader to understand
well that is something like the first question we had
the story commands its own method of telling it
some stories can be told quite simply and objectively like this little boys reactions to the adult world that he had to cope with
other stories demand more probing into what makes men and women tick that is this little boy could show could show what made him tick by his simple speech and actions
there are other times when the action and the speech wont show that so the craftsman s got to dig around to find some other method to use to show what he hopes to tell
and its not that the ones i like are the ones in which ive done the in which im obscure
they re they re the ones that have caused me the most trouble
i think none of the books that any writer does are quite good enough
that s why he writes another one
the ones that he labors the hardest over or worries the most about he develops this the same affection for that the parent does for the for the unfortunate child the sick child or the mentally unbalanced child but they they all are failures in his opinion because they re not as good
he dont want to be as good as his coevals or even just as good as shakespeare
he wants to be better than shakespeare and homer he know she cant but that s that s what he works for
that s what makes a writers life such a happy one
he always has something to getup tomorrow that he s anxious to do which is to attain the impossible never to reach satiety always to have something a little beyond his reach but still to jump at it to try for it
i was speaking to somebody and they mentioned the fact that one of the adams ori dont know who as a young boy of nine seemed to have the future weight of the world on his shoulder shoulders
as a young child did you show this great genius or future genius did you write or did your mother and father know that you were going to be a great writer someday
what indications were there that you were
well i suspect that to any mother the child is a genius no matter what he does and i suspect that to any father a boy that showed no inclination to be anything but a tramp is not much of anything to him and never will be but i think that probably the writer is being a writer from the time he begins to observe long before he learns to spell
its sometimes a manor woman begins to write at a nearly age
sometimes they wait until middle age or even late in life well did you write very early
yes but not seriously
in ever thought of taking up writing as a serious trade until i met mr sherwood anderson in new orleans and i liked him at once
we would meet in the afternoon
i had a had other jobs then but i would be of fat times and we would walk down in new orleans and he would talk and i would listen
we would meet in the evening and goto a courtyard and and he would talk and i would listen until twelve or one o clock over a bottle of whiskey
the next morning he would be in seclusion working
i wouldnt see him until afternoon and then we would walk and i would listen and he would talk and we would talk and laugh again in the evening and the next morning he d still be writing
and i thought that if that s the sort of life being a writer was then that s the life forme that i would become a writer
and so i started writing a book and after the first page or two i found it was fun and i was at it everyday and i had nt seen mr anderson in three or four weeks and i met mrs
anderson on the street one day
she said we have nt seen you in along time
what s wrong
are you mad at us
i said noma a mim writing a book
and she said good lord
is a wher later and she said it old sherwood you were writing a book
he said do you want him to read it
i had nt thought of anybody reading it
i said well m if he wants to he can
she said well he told me he would make a trade with you
if he dont have to read that manuscript hell tell his publisher to take it
i said done
and so he told his publisher to take it
that show i became a writer which book was that mr faulkner
that was one called soldiers pay the first one that was back in i believe
to what extent can a professional writer call his own shots
do you feel that the publisher senses what your public expects you to write and puts the pressure on you to write a certain way
in my case there s never been any pressure
never never been any pressure at all
i have written manuscripts which which before they were were done i myself decided were not good enough and i burned them up
there have been other manuscripts which i would send to the publisher and he d say for a certain reason we cant print this so i would keep it until times changed and then he d say we can print them now or something like that but there re never been any pressure on mei ve either had the best publishers or maybe some providence watched over me and kept me from from getting into trouble but there s never been any pressure on mean di think that is what makes the fiction writer the poets life the best one because he is his own manor woman
nobody tells him what to door say
if you re a dramatist then you ve got to compromise with actors and directors and with the public or whoever s puts up the money for it the writer is probably the only person alive who can be completely individual to do exactly as he wants to do mr
faulkner is aw something not long ago that took the sound and the fury in the four sections and tried to draw a parallel between the id and ego and superego and the author as a person
dont you think that is indicative of what a lot of critics and scholars are doing with not only you but with contemporary writers making psychological inferences and finding symbols that the author never intended
well i would say that the author didnt deliberately intend but i think that in the same culture the background of of of the critic and of the writer are so similar that apart of of each ones history is the seed which can be translated into the symbols which are standardized within that culture
that is the writer dont have to know freud to have written things which anyone who does know freud can divine and reduce into symbols
and so when the critic finds those symbols they are of course there but they were there as as as inevitably as the critic should should stumble on his own knowledge of freud to discern the symbol
but i think the writer is primarily concerned in telling about people in the only terms he knows which is out of his experience his observation and his imagination
and the experience and the imagination and the observation of a culture are are all the people in that culture partake of it of the same three things more or less
the the critic has a valid part in any culture
i think that its it might be a good thing if most writers were like me and didnt bother to read him
that is the writer knows what is in his book and he knows whether it it failed or didnt fail
the and so its possible that reading the criticisms could do a young writer harm because it could confuse him it could be get him to think in terms of the symbolism which the critic who is usually a good deal more erudite than the writer can find in his work
what was your reaction to the greek production of requiem for a nun
i didnt get to see it
it was a gala night and there was so much running back and forth
that was the day that makarios was freed by the british which was the first day that the british ambassador could come out on the streets of athens at night and so there was a good deal of a celebration so much of being hauled around from one ambassadorial box to another then having togo backstage and and so i didnt get a chance to see the play
i just saw scraps and fragments of it
mr faulkner how do pronounce that county of yours correctly
if you break it down into syllables its its not too difficult
yak nap at a wp hay ok napa taw pha its a chickasaw word meaning water runs slow through the flat land
water flows through slow through the flat land
inline with the question about the sometimes in comprehensibility of the novels to the average reader i will confess it took a little more than three years to read the sound and the fury not only because at first i found it difficult to understand but because later as i did begin to understand it i found it very strong stuff really stronger than i could could take all at once and i wondered how long it took you to write this
it didnt take too long to write it
it started out as a short story and then grew
the the obscurity in a writers work is the is the writers fault
it comes from ava livery valid reason to him its the sense the foreknowledge of death which everyone has
the writer has has been stricken with the passion and beauty of life the world and a demon driven need to express that to put it down on paper or cut it into marble or into music and with that foreknowledge that he has only a limited time to doi the maybe dead tomorrow he s got to do it all while he can still breathe and its a desire a need to put the whole history of the human heart into any and every word every paragraph that he writes and the obscurity comes from a belief which i hold that there is no such thing as was
that is that everyman at any moment in any action of his life is the sum of his whole past and to show that manina book or story intact and whole the long thread of his past has got to be implied or inferred or suggested and i have nt yet found any simple method to do that
the obscurity is not deliberate
i hate that obscurity as much as any reader but i have nt found a better way yet to do it
i bet it was a rewarding experience to keep at it
i wondered too a sive noticed evidences of of characters of in various works of yours of mental instability of one kind or another
for instance the idiot in the sound and the fury and then i remember a an old woman who kept the body of her murdered lover for years and years and maybe that was one of your short stories
yes i wondered whether this comes from study of mental instability or observation or is it imagination for instance an idiot
how can people knowhow these mental processes work
one cant of course
that to the writer is apart of the tragic yet immortal human condition
of course there re not as many idiots in mississippi as in my my books probably but but there are some and and since there are some that is a fact a verity in the tragic and and beautiful human condition though the the novelist is not trying to preach or deliver a message
he he is showing to anyone that will take the trouble to read that there is pity there is injustice there are things in mans condition which should be changed should be rectified and if not that should be be looked on with pity and compassion which is which is apart of beauty too the capacity to for compassion for pity is tome just as splendid as the capacity to be brave heroic
and the the capacity the failure which which is baseness and s in are are are just as have just as much need for compassion as the the mentality which is bad that if one is to change mans condition must one must believe in in the verities of of not only baseness but and bravery but of compassion too never to judge does it give the author as much pain as it does the reader to produce scenes such as when caddy wanted to see her baby and jason just drove by
yes it does but that s the writer is not simply dragging that into to pull a few tears he is he puts that down as an instance of mans injustice to man
that man will always be unjust to many et there must always be be people men and women who are capable of the compassion toward that injustice and the hatred of that injustice and the will to risk public opprobrium to stand up and say this is rotten this stinks i wont have it
do you think anyone really wants to be pitied though
no nobody does
because nobody believe that he deserves pity
how do you feel about the negro in the south
about what about the negro in the south
well that s a that s a big question
could you be a little specific well no
the negro is apart of our economy and our our southern traditions
its true anywhere virginia mississippi or texas the the southern southern the white southerner loves negroes as individual negroes and but he he dont like negroes in the mass as apart from the northerner who in theory loves the negroes in the mass but he s terrified and frightened of individual negroes i think that is a the condition of the negro in the south has got to be changed for the simple reason two simple reasons
one is that he s there s seventeen million of him now
he is diffuse over the country to where he can be a political factor anywhere and also if we are to cope with with a culture which says that man is of no importance as measured and matched against the state if were to cope with that and be successful we ourselves have got to have a culture in which any man is of infinite importance much more important than the state and we cant have seventeen million second class citizens in a culture like that and have anybody believe it
but its a slow process
it will take a great deal of patience and and good sense but it must be done mr
faulkner do you believe that integration as defined by the supreme court will come to mississippi at anytime in the near future or future
it wont come into mississippi or anywhere else because of any decision of any court
that s something that has got to be settled by people
but the yes i think that whether integration may possibly never come in in the sense that people think of it i think that equality for the negro will come
i think if the negro has political equality to vote if he has economic equality if he has educational equality then he wont want to mix with white folks anymore than white folks wanted to mix him because i cant imagine any negro after the his experience with white folks wanting to be that close to them but he has he will get equality
if its given to him by a supreme court uk as e and enforced with police as soon as the police are gone then some smart whiteman or even smart negro will take his equality away from him again
he has got to be taught the responsibility of equality
that the that the constitution never said everybody is to have happiness
they want to have the right to gain happiness if they could and and happiness or freedom is something that you ve got to work for
if it if it were not to be worked for it wouldnt be worth having
its got to be worked for and defended who was the irish member of parliament who said man god hath vouchsafed man liberty only under condition of eternal vigilance which condition if he break it servitude is the consequence of his crime the punishment of his guilt
well that s true of anyone
you cant have freedom unless you deserve it and work to keep it
that s and equality of course is freedom
which book do you consider to be your greatest book
none of them are good enough forme
they all failed
the one that imi love the best is the one that made the most splendid failure which is the sound and the fury
that s the one i worked at the hardest but none of them are good enough which is why i wrote another one this year and ill write another one next year and i have every intention of living to be about a hundred years old still trying to write a book of course i wont but ill still try
you ve written for both tv and motion pictures
i wondered which medium you would prefer to work with
i didnt work for either one seriously because that is not my bent for the reason i stated that in either one it is a matter of compromise a compromise with with the actor with the director and mainly with the people that put up the money
its its so expensive atv show or a moving pictures how
ive had a great deal of of fun working for moving pictures because i liked the people i worked with but in ever took working for any of them seriously
it was just a pleasant way to get a check every saturday night tome
mr faulkner i would like to know what you think of ernest hemingway as a writer what is your opinion of him
he is a man who has has never betrayed the his integrity which which one accepts to be a writer
he learned early in life a method by which he could do his work
he has never varied from that method
it it suited him
he handled it well
if his work continues then its going to get better
his last book i think the oldman and these a was the best because he discovered something which he had never found before which was god up to that time his people functioned in a vacuum they had no past but suddenly in the oldman and these a he found god
there was the big fish god made the big fish that had to be caught
god made the oldman that had to catch the big fish
god made the shark that had to eat the fish and god loved all of them and if his work goes on from that then it will will still be better which is something that not all writers can say
they too many tragically write themselves out too young and then their lives are unhappy that happened with fitzgerald happened with sherwood anderson and so they they goto pieces
can you keep up with the younger generation the and all the younger people and what the young people are doing
or is that too important
not actually
i think that all writers or maybe all people as they get older they read less and less
the books i read now are the books that i read and loved when i was twenty one years old
unless someone puts the book in my hand and says read this
then i read its oid on tim not too familiar with with the work of of the young writer nowadays
young writers come to see me and talk tome and so i know more young writers than i know their work
i wondered what s your opinion of john steinbeck now
steinbeck tome has probably not done his best work
so far he s a better reporter than he is a novelist
and i think maybe his best work is still to come sir what are some of your favorite books
don quixote some of conrad heart of darkness the nigger of the narcissus most of dickens the brothers karamazov anna karenina madame bovary the old testament
i suppose i have about fifty that i read igo in and out like you go into a room to meet old friends
i open the book in the middle and read for a little while and i imagine over the course of every ten years i would have read all of them through mr
faulkner are these books then indicative of the authors who have written them and people who have had the most influence on you as a writer
i think that any writer is influenced by every word he ever read in his life from the telephone book up and down that he himself cannot say what book influenced him at what time
it maybe if he went back over his work he could pick out pages scenes and could see the derivation but he never has time to do that because by that time he s busy writing another book
actually a sive said said before one virtue in being a writer is that everytime you finish a book that s one book you ll never have to read you refinished with that one
but im sure that any writer is influenced by everything that he has read by everything he has seen
he is completely amoral
he will take what he needs from any source but then he is willing to reciprocate that anyone after him can take what they find in his work that they can use but hell have no compunction about stealing right and left
not deliberately but he sits his storehouse and when he needs i the uses it this pertains then to both ideas and techniques of writing
well ideas in the sense of learning how people behave
i think that he doesnt bother about taking the abstract ideas of other writers because unless that abstract idea fits some character which he himself feels that he s invented then he will take it but but the fiction writer is not too interested in ideas anymore than he s very interested in facts that he s interested in people and and in man and his the infinite variety of his mutations and his struggles and comical errors and tragic mistakes and his successes his hopes not in his ideas but in his eternal conflict with himself with his fellows or with his environment
that s what the fiction writers writing about
it takes a philosopher to write about ideas and most writers have been so busy scribbling from childhood that they never had time to get much schooling to know much about ideas mr
faulkner sherwood anderson and ts
eliot seem to feel that there has been no classic since virgil s aeneid and i wonder to what extent you have grownup in philosophy or ideas
well im sure if i ever read virgil i cant remember whether i did or not ive stolen from him to of or the reason that the writer is influenced by everything he ever ever read
but i dont think that as long as the writer is busy writing he s got time to make any didactic statements about where culture stopped and where it didnt stop
that he s not really interested in culture or even interested in literature until he writes himself out and he has been corrupted by by books so much that he has nothing else to do with his time save to take up being a literary man
most writers are not literary men
they re really they re craftsmen then you believe that mr eliot underestimates his culture apparently
nono
that he s perfectly imperfectly willing for him to have his opinions but to mei a in t interested in it
mr faulkner you said a writer knows when he succeeds or fails and i gather you dont use the critics opinions as a guide
what gives you the sense of having failed or succeeded in a book
that would probably be the worst day the writer ever ever faces because then nothing remains but to cut his throat
i think that he would the only way to express it is what hemingway means by saying to feelgood
he finishes the job and and there s nothing that is still dangling nothing more he wants to do to it
its finished
its complete
as long as its failed there s always something youth in know if i could just go back and do this over i could do it better
but you know that s a waste of time
the best thing is to take a new story
gap in tape all the horror and difficulty pessimism a lot of pessimism in the world today
do you sort of take a dim view of the human race surviving or do you think well goon forever and ever and ever
nono
i dont think that anything scientists can cook up in a laboratory is going to do away with man
that when this completing your writing whether you start writing it or does it develop as you go
it usually develops as igo
it can begin with an anecdote or or an action or a character
then when enough people get in it to begin to talk back and forth to each other and to impact on one another and to begin to quarrel with one another they take charge of the story
all i have to do then is to trot along behind with a notebook and a pencil and put down what they door say then of course at the end you have togo back to the rules of unity and coherence and emphasis and give it some sort of shape but but the characters take take charge of the story
that s my own system
other people work from plots and diagrams and keep notes
in ever had a notebook and never did any research
mine is done for pleasure for fun will will a mansion follows the same characters as the town
yes that s right do you see it
you reworking on it now
yes
do you believe that there is a american language developing as compared to the english language or that they are the same language
yes mi think so
i dont knowhow many generations eons before it will be too distinct but any language if it is not changing will not last long
that is the only alternative to change and progress is death
it maybe with the with the world being condensed by rapid transportation there ll be even less divergence of the two languages than ever but i would say that there will be be a change and in time there will be just as much difference between the english english and american english as as there is between classic greek and modern greek unless both have been abolished in the meantime and there s still another language that comprises both which will also be in a state of flux and change and advancement
do you think that an author is actually getting into hot water if he doesnt stick to subjects that he himself has experienced
nono the imagination will serve
you stick to experience and observation are only shortcuts but imagination will will well serve
its it has served so many writers when they need i think right now all these books of so called science fiction i think of hg
wells time machine that there s absolutely no limit to what man can imagine and he and by by using a few simple mechanical fact she can make it credible that is nobody can dispute him if what he he says holds together assuming you grant his premise
thankyou
make the statements which which we will follow which the rest of the south must follow
i was a little ashamed for all of us when your government issued those invitations and then had to retract some of them the sort of thing that you d expect mississippi to do but mississippi dont expect virginia to
experiences here that i will after i had left virginia and have thought about it i will realize more and more how how pleasant it was the contact with the people the young people that have come into my office with their carefully rehearsed literary questions and once we get past them we just talk and that s interesting
they they tell me what they want to do and what they think about the condition what we should do about it
almost everyday one comes in and once we get past the stiffness of that first question which which they have rehearsed because they re seeing me then you get down to a human being as someone said the
that s that s better
i went out to albemarle school one morning and it it took a little thawing but after a while it became quite well
by the end of it there was a young man trying to sell me some cattle
another man wanted to swap horses with me
well i dont mean this to be a carefully rehearsed literary question but i did notice in the paper where you mentioned that the old testament was among your old literary friends or one of the ones that you like to browse in and reread yes and i realize it is a classic but i was wondering why the new testament did not have as much to offer
is it because it is so narrative or some of it isnt useful
tome the new testament is full of ideas and i dont know much about ideas
the old testament is full of people perfectly ordinary normal heroes and blackguards just like everybody else nowadays and i like to read the old testament because its full of people not ideas
its people all trying to get something for nothing or or to be braver than they are
just ordinary everyday folks people that s why i like to read that
that s apart from the fine poetry of the of the prose
ido have a carefully rehearsed one but im really interested in your to build a picture of this vastly materialistic american society which cant tolerate a writer or human being seven
and yet you seem to indicate that there was some hope to get for americans to get beyond this purely materialistic stage and yet in your writing it it seems that the s nope ses have triumphed and i wondered if you dc are to comment on that
i dont believe i said that our culture cant tolerate it
what i meant to say there was that so far our culture is not aware that there is a force we deal in terms of the human spirit that the day will come when it will have to become aware of it
so far it doesnt need to and its not that it objects
it simply isnt aware yet that that s a force that exists about the s nope stheno fiction writer is interested primarily in messages or warnings but indirectly and by coincidence he does suggest messages and warnings
the the story of the s nope s is not this is what the south is coming to
its its simply this is what can happen if we dont watch these people
that its all imaginary
they are underlined for emphasis
they are exaggerated for emphasis but this is what can happen if we dont watch it
as a student who always had to struggle through literature courses trying to dig out the meanings of things which seemed obvious to other people id be curious to know if as a writer you sort of do have these messages in mind greater ideas which the english teachers and so forth always produce so readily and some of the students cant find the many where
nom not really
the writer is writing about people
he has got to use the tools he has which is his own experience his own observation and out of that in the course of of twenty one twenty two years it takes to mature then whatever years after that come the opinions
he doesnt have to stop and say now this is what i believe
its there
he dont know he s got it
then when he writes suddenly something somebody says something he says well yes that s so
that s what i believe too
he didnt put that in the characters mouth
the character said this is what i think
the writer says yes i agree with you
that he is too busy dealing with people to have time to deliver messages to anyone
the messages happen just by chance
that he is interested in in creating flesh and blood people to do the tragic or the comic things which people do for for pleasure
that is i think that one should read for pleasure that one doesnt necessarily have to read for pleasure but i myself read for pleasure not for ideas that if it sive got to hunt around in a book to looking for an idea the nid rather do something else
id rather do something that s more fun than that
it wont be reading
although you primarily write about the south and southern people are you striving for universality that people who live in another locality can use it
that s it
its to use a locale which the writer is most familiar with
it saves him doing research
that is if he dont know anything about california or canada or australia if he dont do a little research first hell write something and somebody will say holdup here
that a in tso
this is the way it is in australia
where if he writes about what he knows nobody is going to bother him that way because he knows what he is putting down
people are the same but its the differences in their background the milieu they function in which is different not their behavior
but then of course the milieu the background the environment will will change the terms of the behavior not the act itself and so the writer simply uses the background he knows just as the carpenter uses the tools that he has a this hand
rather than togo somewhere to borrow a hammer or a saw he will use the one he s got so he wont have to fetch one
i believe somerset maugham said at one time that he felt it was rather asad thing in his own life and assumed it to be in the life of any writer in that he felt that he had to divorce himself from life itself to a certain extent in that he was continually observing and thinking in terms of writing down what he saw
and i think that possibly he felt a little deprived in that he had this demon which caused him to want to do this and that he could not live himself more as ordinary people do and well in that he was more concerned with recording life as he saw it and living it was more like a vicarious sense
do you feel that that is true of most writers or did you find something else true
well it is not true of of mean di imagine its not true of of many other writers
it would be true of would be true of of many other writers
i think that maugham of an older older culture had more time to be that objective about his own sub subjectivity if you can accept that paradoxical statement
i think that maybe henry james for instance had the same approach toward his work that maugham did but henry james had not got far enough to realize that that was depriving him of something that he didnt want to be deprived of
that is henry james probably was quite happy to live detached from life to write henry james
i hesitate to ask such abroad question sir but what effect do you think mccarthyism has had on freedom of thought and expression in american universities
i would say that mccarthyism that whole thing has had a good effect on american universities in that it has has shown not the educated man but has shown a lot of of uneducated people what that sort of thing can cause that uneducated people have a greater belief in the that thought the freedom of thought must be inviolable that they never thought about it before and so in that sense mccarthy served a purpose
its too bad that that should be one of the curses of democracy too that that purpose cant must be paid for with the three or four years of mccarthy
in away democracy has the capacity to use somehow almost everything
this this is a question about your way of writing
i was wondering whether you you constantly go about the writing or whether it just comes out all at once
because to read a book of yours it seems to come all at once but i just wondered you hear of so many writers who are working over their novels and rewriting parts until they refinished
that depends and i dont think that any writer could have a hard and fast rule about it
in my own case im lazy
that is i dont like to s it down and and put a hundred thousand words on paper
i hate to face the fact that ive got to do it
i will put that off as long as possible and so in the meantime as much of the revising as possible happens up here
then when the demon wont let meal one any longer is it down to write and i try to do it so i wont have to revise it wont have to do it again sometimes it works
sometimes ill have to rewrite and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite sometimes it it never comes out to suit me
ill throw it away
but occasionally im lucky and the first times enough but no writer can know beforehand whether hell have to do it once or a dozen times but he has got to please himself and he will he will curse it
he will curse his fate that he ever got into such a racket but he will keep on until its thebes the can do with it
there was a young lady back there that i was just wondering if you thought that some sort of form of government subsidy some of the european writers
i dont think i heard that too well
if you will tell me again ma amdo you think that artists in this country would benefit from some form of government subsidization that is like like the author programs italy has or
i dont think that an artist should be subsidized too much by anyone
i think that he has got to be free and even a little hardship maybe good for him
that im assuming that most artists are like me and and they are lazy and if they had too much money they would do that much less work that if they a in t got much money just enough to buy a little tobacco and occasionally a drink and and something to eat that they might work a little more
if it was too easy for them they would put off the work
that now that s different from the opera because opera theater requires so much more money than the cost of are am of paper and and three or four pencils so theater has got to be subsidized and and if private capital is ever obliterated then there will have to be subsidy to print the books but the artist himself shouldnt be subsidized too much
he would be a little better off if he had to hold another job and and wrote in his sparetime because that would keep his work on the plane of the amateur which it should be
that when he begins to think of himself as a professional writer he is sunk
he s got to do it because its fun
its got to be a hobby
siri m going to put you on the spot with this
you say that a writer must write truth and he must therefore he must search for truth
if arthur miller is found guilty of contempt on the grounds that as he claims moral his own moral character which kept him from revealing the names of other writers in his cell that he once visited would you publicly come out in favor of his position
sure
yes if there there s something you believe is wrong to do then dont do it no matter who else disagrees with you
that would have nothing to do with what whether he writes from now on whether he s in contempt of of court or not
whether he is sent to jailor not would have nothing to do with what he writes
yes if you believe that something is wrong to do dont do it are there any other questions
well we want you to knowhow glad we are that your demon let you come over here tonight and be with us and well all remember this as a highlight of this year and probably along time to come
thankyou ma am
has consented to come and talk to us about the oldman
we ve been talking about the oldman for the last week and been discussing it its structure and its meaning and its techniques in isolation unconnected with the work with which it was originally published in alternating chapters the wild palms
our questions to mr faulkner will be completely unrehearsed and un screened according to your desire and i think this is the first time that you ve talked to a freshman class and so it will be interesting to observe what emerges
mr faulkner has consented to begin the meeting by reading the end of the oldman
mr faulkner
that was all the convict told them
they left the sawmill fast he had no time to buy food until they reached the next next landing
there he spent the whole sixteen dollars he had earned and they went on
the river was lower now there was no doubt of it and sixteen dollars worth looked like a lot of food and he thought maybe it would do would be enough
but maybe there was more current in the river still than it looked like
but this time it was mississippi it was cotton the plow handles felt right to his palms again the strain and squat of the thick buttocks against the middle busters blade was what he knew eventhough they paid but a dollar a day here
but that did it
he told it they told him it was saturday again and paid him and he told about it night a smoked lantern in a disc of worn and barren earth as smooth as silver a circle of crouching figures the importunate murmurs and ejaculations the meagre piles of worn bills beneath the crouching knees the dotted cubes clicking and sc uttering in the dust that did it
how much did you win
the second convict said
enough the tall one said
how much
enough the tall one said
it was enough exactly he gave it all to the man who owned the second motorboat he would not need food now he and the woman in the launch now and the skiff towing behind it the woman with the baby and the paper wrapped parcel beneath his peaceful hand on his lap almost at once he recognised not vicksburg because he had never seen vicksburg but the trestle beneath which on his roaring wave of trees and houses and dead animals he had shot accompanied by thunder and lightning a month and three weeks ago he looked at it once without heat even without interest as the launch went on
but now he began to watch the bank the levee
he didnt knowhow he would know but he knew he would and then it was early afternoon and sure enough the moment came and he said to the launch owner i reckon this will do
here
the launch owner said
this dont look like anywhere tome
i reckon this is it the convict said
so the launch put inshore the engine ceased it drifted up and lay against the levee and the owner cast the skiff loose
you better let me take you on until we come to something he said
that was what i promised
i reckon this will do the convict said
so they got out and he stood with the grapevine painter in his hand while the launch purred again and drew away already curving he did not watch it
he laid the bundle down and made the painter fast to a willow root and picked up the bundle and turned
he said no word he mounted the levee passing the mark the tide line of the old raging dry now and lined traversed by shallow and empty cracks like foolish and deprecatory senile grins and entered a willow clump and removed the overalls and shirt they had given him in new orleans and dropped them without even looking to see where they fell and opened the parcel and took out the other the known the desired faded a little stained and worn but clean recognisable and put them on and returned to the skiff and took up the paddle
the woman was already in it
the plump convict stood blinking at him
so you comeback he said
well well
now they all watched the tall convict as he bit the end from the cigar neatly and with complete deliberation and spat it out and licked the bite smooth and damp and took a match from his pocket and examined the match for a moment as though to be sure it was a good one worthy of the cigar perhaps and raked it up his thigh with the same deliberation a motion almost too slow to set fire to it it would seem and held it until the flame burned clear and free of sulphur then he put it to the cigar
the plump one watched him blinking rapidly and steadily
and they give you ten years more for running
that s bad
a fellow can get used to what they give him at first to start off with i dont care how much it is even a hundred and ninety nine years
but ten more years
ten years more on top of that
when you never expected it
ten more years to have to do without no society no female companionship he blinked steadily at the tall convict
but he the tall convict had thought of that too
he had had a sweetheart
that is he had gone to church singing s and picnics with her a girl a year or so younger than he short legged with ripe breasts and a heavy mouth and dull eyes like ripe musca dines who owned a baking powder can almost full of earrings and brooches and rings bought or presented at suggestion from tencent stores
presently he had divulged his plan to her and there were times later when musing the thought occurred to him that perhaps if it had not been for her he would not actually have attempted it this a mere feeling un worded since he could not have phrased this either that who to know what capone sun candled bride hood she might not have dreamed to be her destined fate what fast car filled with authentic colored glass and machine guns running traffic lights
but that was all past and done when the notion first occurred to him and in the third month of his incarcerations he came to see him
she wore earrings and a bracelet or so which he had never seen before and it never became quite clear how she had got that far from home and she cried violently for the first three minutes though presently and without his ever knowing either exactly how they had got separated or how she had made the acquaintance he saw her in animated conversation with one of the guards
but she kissed him before she left that evening and said she would return the first chance she got clinging to him sweating a little smelling of scent and soft young female flesh slightly pneumatic
but she didnt comeback though he continued to write to her and seven months later he got an answer
it was a postcard a colored lithograph of a birmingham hotel with a childish x inked heavily across one window the heavy writing on the reverse slanted and primer like too this is where were hon ny mon ning at
your friend mrs vernon wal drip the plump convict stood blinking at the tall one rapidly and steadily
yes sir he said
its them ten more years that hurt
ten more years to do without a woman no woman at all a fellow wants he blinked steadily and rapidly watching the tall one
the other did not move jackknifed backward between the two bunks grave and clean the cigar burning smoothly and richly in his clean steady hand the smoke wreathing upward across his face saturnine humorless and calm
ten more years women blank
the tall convict said
was there something that influenced you to write this story
yes the story i was trying to tell was the story of of of charlotte and harry wilbour ne
i decided that it needed a contrapuntal quality like music and so i wrote the other story simply to underline the story of charlotte and harry
i wrote the two stories by alternate chapters
id write the chapter of one and then i would write the chapter of the other just as the musician puts inputs counterpoint behind the theme that he is working with
well why dont in this story none of the characters have names
tome the story was simply for background effect and and they didnt need names
they just needed to be people in motion doing the exact opposite thing to the tragedy of of harry and charlotte in the other story
tome they didnt need names that they were not too important
siri noticed that you do have some names though in your story
some names are mentioned such as bledsoe the convict
do you do you have them in for any reason
well the girl that jilted him she had to have a name to sign to the postcard
the other people if i dont remember the rest of the story because i haven tread it in about thirty years but when they had names it was for that reason as simple as that at at the moment they had to have a name
well in the swamp three of the men who lived in the swamp you gave them the name stine and to to and the ule and i wonder if those names had any type of significance or were supposed to be any type of literary allusion
they re rather colorful names i think
noi dont think so
they were were names you might say indigenous to that almost un human class of people which live between the mississippi river and the levee
they belong to no state
they belong to no nation
they they are not citizens of anything and sometimes they behave like they dont even belong to the human race so you have had experiences with these people
yes
yes i remember once i was going one of them was going to take me hunting
he invited me to come and stay with his kinfolks whatever kin they were in ever did know a shanty boat in the river and i remember the next morning for breakfast we had a bought chocolate cake and a cold possum and corn whiskey they had given me the best they had
i was company
they had had given me the best food they had
if i may aska question pursuing this idea
i believe that earlier in your life that you did quite a bit of traveling and had a lot of experiences as an apprentice seaman i believe and flying
do you think that to any author or even more generally to anyone who wants to formulate ideas about life and all do you think that this is very valuable while younger to travel around and not be fixed down or
well it it dont do you any harm but its you dont have to do it
homer probably didnt do a great deal of traveling and he did pretty well as a writer
i that is the material you write from has got to be a good deal more than just what you can see and remember
its its got to be observation experience which and part of experience is what you read plus imagination
so the observation dont hurt you
you may need it but you can get along without it if you have to with the imagination and experience i think the best source to learn to be a writer is from reading what the best the giants of of the past have done
did the tall convict in the oldman believe in god
he probably had nt got around to that yet
his background would be the bucolic provincial southern baptist and it maybe a debatable question whether that sort of baptist believes in god or not but probably when he got older and got out of the penitentiary if he ever did and he didnt need to expend too much energy trying to have fun anymore he might have taken up religion might have been a professor of god whether he believed it or not or even know what god was
but at this time he would would have said he did and if anyone had told him he didn the would have fought him but he probably didnt know what god meant it seems tome in reading the book that he was depending a lot on fate to lead his life that he would be led by fate as much as religion
well he depended more on himself that to him fate was just his bad luck the sort of thing that shouldnt happen to a dog
but he depended on himself that he he knew what he wanted which was to be secure to be back in that penitentiary
that s where he was secure because he didnt mind hard work
he didnt know anything else
and suddenly he was flung out into the world with another woman and all he wanted was to get rid of that woman and get back there where he was safe
but he didnt depend he was doing thebes the could
he depended on his own efforts well when he got back sir did he share this view with the others that it was ten years without women i mean do you think he minded this
nono
he had had enough of women
after that girl had jilted him she was the one that put him there
it was to get a lot of money to buy her a lot more of the woolworth bracelets and rings
if it had nt been for her he wouldnt have been there
he would have been back a this mississippi hill home working hard all day long and drinking a little corn whiskey on saturday nights and gambling
siri m interested in your saying that
id taken it that he had robbed the train more for the adventure and to be able to say that he had evaded the authorities rather than for the money
no
he wanted to please that girl
he didnt need a lot of money
he was doing all right with his mule his little piece of corn land but suddenly her an into a girl that wanted a lot of woolworth rings and so he had to turn robber to get those rings
well is this inability or desire not to face women also the kind of thing that the plump convict wound up in this penitentiary because he didnt want to face the raging woman with whom he had committed this crime
did do you mean this also to be his desire not to face life into face reality or the return to the womb
you mentioned too you spoke of christmas as being chained by a clanking umbilical and we talked about this in this in my class his jackknife position and the whole idea of escaping from life dodoes the woman here especially the pregnant woman represent life in this sense
not to the convict
that is not consciously
he all he wanted to escape from was in security
he anyone that could betaken over the jumps by the sort of girl that was that got him into undertaking to be a bank robber couldnt have been very mature mentally that convict was probably still about fifteen or sixteen years old
and like a boy of of fifteen or sixteen the first shock of of disappointment in love he thinks is going to last forever
of course it dont but that s what he thinks and the convict never had grownup yet
dont you think the seven weeks of there the seven years he lost
well now that s the sort of thing that if any reader likes to find that in the writers work he is as far as the writer is concerned perfectly welcome to find it but the writer a in t got time to watch all those all those corners and and symbols and implications so its very possible you re right but but in ever thought of that before
do you think that if the convict had not been given the extra ten years do you think he would have returned to the security of prison or to the security of his home
well that extra ten years meant nothing to him because he was mentally about sixteen or seventeen years old and anything any sum of time longer than one year is all the same to you when you re fifteen or sixteen years old that in another year and you ll bean oldman anyway and so what sten years more or a hundred years to him
getting back to this security or in security do you think that enough background was given of the tall convict before he was in in the penitentiary before he was sentenced to leave him feel insecure do you think that he first became insecure when he was in the penitentiary for so long a time being out of it of of being insecure
noi would that the in security came to him with a shock when that woman betrayed him and he was frightened and he wanted to be where no other woman could catch him off balance and take him over the jumps again
and the place where he was safe from that was in that penitentiary which wasnt so different from the life he would have led if he d been home
he would have had to work very hard all day long at home
he would have had very little for it which was just what he got there but atleast behind that barbed wire fence he was safe from another woman that would get him into the highwayman business do you think he would have stayed on the island with the cajun s if had nt they had to leave
nono
he had to get rid of that woman and the only way he knew to get rid of her was to bring her back to the folks that sent him together
remember he s mentally only about fifteen or sixteen years old and by his own light she s quite honorable and dependable
they had sent him out with a boat to get two people and he did thebes the could to get the two people and bring them and the boat back
well why i know that you said that the woman was almost exactly like him i mean the same type of background and everything and also the woman must have realized that he was trying together back but dont you was the woman also in this immature state that she didnt realize that she could get back more quickly when they were in this armory which is where they had all these other people she was glad to leave with him and when when she was just about ready to have her child and she she made as i recall nono cry to the people in this houseboat to let her come aboard
she was content almost it seems like to just stick with him
why is this
i mean why didnt she try to better herself
she didnt knowhow
she was as ignorant as he was
she came from the same class of people that he came from she was ignorant
she was she was afraid of strangers
of course the convict was a stranger to her too but they had been hurled together by a circumstance and it probably didnt take her very long to find out that all that convict wanted was together back where he g other from and get rid of her and that s what she wanted too to get back and find her husband
she probably had a husband
she may have had other children and she wanted to get back just as bad as he did and since he he was the man her instinct was to let the man run things
did you mean to show miscarriage of justice by having the additional ten years or rather just to show that although it seemed like injustice that the jail warden was doing exactly what should have been done anyway just because of his knowledge of the people under his care
that additional ten years was simply another quantity in in fate just like the flood that her an into
once he was in i the had to accept the extra ten years just as he accepted the flood and worked through it and survived it
there was nono more injustice than there was to the flood
it was just something that was in the culture the economy of of the land he lived in just like that flood was inherent in the in the geography and the climate and he was a man that said well if this is what it is ill do the best i can to tough through it that would have been his philosophy
so when you set out to start a novel such as this do you have a complete story in mind or is it just a thought that you buildup on as you go along
you remember this was a counterpoint to the other story
this tome wasnt too important that these were just the the orchestration of sounds that the musician puts back of the theme of his symphony
that i didnt know where this story was going i just wrote it
i was as surprised as anybody else to find where it was going but the story that i was trying to tell was the story of of charlotte and harry and when you reached the point where he met the woman what was your purpose of having a pregnant woman
it i thought that made it funnier
tome all this is funny a little little more comical to show this man who meant well to get involved in in all sorts of things that would have made a weaker or less centered man blench and falter but not him
it was because he was just stupid and ignorant enough to bull right on through this to accept anything the gods threw at him without even knowing that he was being tried
well if this is primarily funny and ido think that there s humor all through it why do you put the humor in where you do for example the woman i dont recall the remark but she s just about ready to have her child and you say something about hold on a little longer
its an impossible thing
and then he s been kicked by a kicked by the tail of the alligator and she asks him if he s been kicked and he says no that if he d goth it in there are nd with a pea shooter
it would make there s humor all the way through and then even at the end do you still want the message of this seeming injustice of society against him to come through or is that secondary
well its secondary is not really wrong because it was the injustice was necessary to make the story funny and so its not secondary because it was quite important to make the story funny
its its a fact and if one begins to write about the injustice of society the none has stopped being primarily a novelist and has become a polemic is tora propagandist
the fiction writer is not that
he will use the injustice of society the inhumanity of people as as any other tool in telling the story which which is about people not about the injustice or the inhumanity of people but of people with their aspirations and their struggles and the bizarre the comic and the tragic conditions they get them in themselves into simply coping with themselves and one another and environment
i think you must have put a great deal of time behind choosing the title of the oldman
i know you took it from the river but i wonder what else you had in mind
possibly does the river symbolize any other things or maybe nature or something else
no
its its not the oldman its oldman
that s what the negroes along the river call the river
they never call it the mississippi nor the river
its just oldman
and this had to have some title and so that struck me as being a good title for it
that refers simply to the river did the tall convict have any subconscious attitudes toward the mississippi
no he d never seen it before it was just a lot of water to him not behaving like any water he ever saw before behave but it was that was just something that your an into and you had to handle it the best you could
he never did know where he was and didnt really care in the book you had elaborated to some extent on the fact that the old the oldman was fruitful and life giving and such and what it was to farmers and just to the people who lived along the mississippi and to that area
it it was fruitful and not a destructive force
well the destructive quantity had to be accepted too
that country where this took place was is alluvial its lower than the river itself
in the winter it stayed underwater from from the fall rains sometimes as late as june
that was why they had to build the levees and so in the spring and the summer the river is higher than the land
theresa levee and then you lookup in the sky and there goes a steamboat
if the levee ever gives way the country will be flooded again
its rich because the river for for hundreds of years had deposited the rich silt on top of the ground and so the river dominates not only the economy of that country but it it dominates its its spiritual life
that the river is master of it and anytime the oldman wants to he can can break the levee and can ruin the cotton crop
that in away you re the planter is at armistice with him and the superstitious planter believes that he has got to make libations make sacrifices to him
that every so often he s got to let the oldman come in and take that cotton crop to keep the oldman in a contented frame of mind like the ancients with with the dragon the minotaur the symbols of of destructiveness which they had to placate sacrifice
in putting this woman in the boat with the convict did you want to draw a point to the lovers in the novel that went along with it or did you just put her in the boat assort of a hindrance to progress and
no that was a definite parallel
the the isolation the solitude of of the boat in that raging torrent was the solitude which harry and charlotte had had tried so long to find where they could be lovers to escape from from the world
they went to infinite labor and risk and sacrifice to escape from the world where this convict had been hurled out of the world against his will whether he wanted to or not
that he and and the woman he saved had what charlotte and and and wilbour ne had sacrificed everything to get
that s what i mean by counterpoint to the theme of the other book that these two people had what charlotte and harry had given up everything respectability future everything for
sir the short fat convict which you placed in the book you call him you say he s somewhat like something one might find under a log
is he there just to emphasize the qualities of the tall convict
that s right
and to have somebody for the tall convict to or to dig out of the tall convict what had happened
the tall convict would never have told this himself
he d just said he was away for a while and had a pretty hard time but here he is
that s all he could have told about what happened to him
you said that the convict wasnt afraid of work so he returned
yet when he was in the swamp with the cajun s you say that he had forgotten what work was like or something like that
do you make a distinction between work for a reward and then work simply for the sake of something to do
he had been so busy trying to keep that boat from being swamped and to get them along from one day to another which was terrific work but to him that wasnt work anymore than somebody falling off a roof that scrabbles at at shingles and and chimney pots would consider himself working
work to him was the orderly the work of from sunup to sundown and then you rested and then tomorrow you worked again but he did consider the work at the prison just as much as yes but he had he had been gone from there along time to him
that must have seemed like years to him that he had had been in that boat with that woman who was a nuisance
you sort of draw you drew a line somewhere in there between the work at the prison and the work with the with the alligators because he seemed to work just as hard trapping the alligators because he was going to get part of the profits from the alligators
that s right was there did did that make a difference in the type of in the work that he was doing and the way he went about it when he went to prison
well work to him meant the orderly work of following a mule in a furrow
catching alligators to him wasnt work in in by his lights anymore than struggling with that boat was work and the solitude but she but she wasnt enough he had togo and get into trouble over somebody else s wife
what did the tremendous wave signify and what caused it
that simply is a physical fact in that country when a levee breaks
the water rushed through the crevasse and it it came to the lowest place which was a stream which up to that time had been flowing toward the river this wave of water from the at that time the river the mississippi was forty feet higher than the country and when that levee gave way that mass of water that came through had togo somewhere and it broke on the east side of the river so that wave of water simply continued togo east until it spent itself and in this this stream which up till that time had been flowing placidly west it turned around and ran backward
that s just a physical fact of of hydraulics and levee
it seems that you draw a picture for yourself before you draw a picture do you do that in your writing itself when you are writing a book draw another picture for yourself before
oh well any writer puts down what he sees and what he hears and that image and and that sound come from the proper blending of observation experience and imagination
yes you ve got to see what you the scene you describe
you ve got to hear the voice speaking the speech that you put down
you ve you have to hear the vernacular he speaks in rather than to think of the speech and then translate into the vernacular
sir you want to establish the intellectual level of these people you re talking about but i noticed were missing this mississippi accent which is so prevalent in those people
you made no attempt to simulate that in the dialect
is there any reason for that
if the writer puts too much attention to transcribing literally the dialogue he hears its confusing to people who have never heard that speech
that is some some of the words are difficult to spell
they would be to a mississippian he would see the words spelled the way a mississippian would spell i the would knowhow it sounded but to an out lander he wouldnt know
he would mispronounce that word wrong you can can go only so far with with dialect and then theresa point where for for the simple reason not to make too much demand on the writer to distract his attention from the story you retelling you ve got to draw the line
sir you said imagination is enough for writing it makes a good writer
do you believe that thomas wolfe uses a lot of imagination in his writing or do you think that he just wrote primarily from experience
i think that no writer writes primarily from experience or observation or imagination
its as though he has three tanks with three lines and maybe a mixing valve and he draws from that tap from all three of them and he himself can never say how much of this was imagination how much was observation how much was experience
he he couldnt and then he he wouldnt bother to because that s not too important
if what he tells seems real and seems true then how much of what came from where and when makes no difference to him
its a rather small passage but in one place he son the indian mound with the woman and he s lost his oar and he s trying to make a new one and he has this dream that he s trying that he s back at the bunkhouse and he s attempting to sleep but there is a mule john henry keeps trying to crawl into bed with him and he licks him with his cold tongue
is that supposed to have any special symbolism such as work or anything or is this
nono that s what it felt like to him when whatever the animal was that was crawling over him while he was asleep made him think of he he reduced that to his own imagination observation and experience
when did you come into the close contact with a flood on the mississippi that the text would indicate and when did you observe all these things the way the flood happened and so forth

hmmm why i cant say
ive known it all my life
that is this country is not very far from where i was born and have lived all my life and i have known these people
i have known that country
every fall as long as i can remember we would go there to hunt bear and deer which was close to the levee and so we would know these people
they would cross the levee and come into our camp
they would they were lawless people
they would be beggars and on occasion they would be thieves but if we were ever benighted lost at night we could goto their shanty boats and shacks and they would give us what they had to eat and let us sleep that night
on several occasions the tall convict is plagued by this nosebleed that he cant control
this usually follows some period where he shada great struggle and shown his bravery and his strength such as with the alligator
is this helplessness in the face of this nosebleed supposed to be a humorous contrast with his strength and his usual self sufficiency
or did you want to
well tome that was just something else comical and and bizarre that should have he should be afflicted with that also
with all his other trouble she had had that what s the name of it the ailment when your blood wont clot hemophilia
yes that on top of everything else he had to have that too
this is just one sentence which i wonder about
in the beginning of this final chapter and you told you sort of described the governors emissary and you say that he just s at down on the desk you say almost between the warden and the caller the emissary and you say this is the sentence or these are the sentences or the vizier vizier with the command the knotted cord has began to appear immediately
exactly what does that mean
i oh that s eastern from the middle east
when the sultan decided he was tired of a of a courtier he would send his primeminister with a knotted cord to suggest that he choke himself to death
that s all
sir when you write any of your novels do you usually have a definite idea of how its going to happen and outline it or do you just let the novel carry itself as you go along
sometimes there is a general idea of what the end might be that is an anecdote or a scene or it could be a scene at the at the first first of the book ori dont know until i start where the scene might come
it could begin with a character or it could begin with a with an idea n idea out of mans condition
that is in ab salom ab salom that began with the idea of a man that wanted a ruthless man that wanted as on and got so many that they destroyed one another and destroyed him but the idea almost at once produced the protagonist which was the man himself
some writers i think have to have a plot
they they do research
they have notebooks and graphs and charts and things but in ever have worked that way
mine begin with with a scene or an anecdote to write toward or with a character and after the characters the people come alive then all the writer has to do is to trot along beside them with a notebook and a pencil and put down what they say and do
of course at the end you ve got to use some discipline to do editing to pick and choose and make the give the whole thing coherence and emphasis at the right place and unity but with me the characters take charge of the story and all i have to do is just put down what they do and say
sir this is slightly pointing out toward another tangent
we were having a discussion in our class as to whether ernest hemingway s novel for whom the bell tolls was didactic or not
would you give your opinion to that
i would say simply that hemingway was writing well in a sense the same story every writer in away is writing one story
that he there s one thing in mans condition that seems to him the most moving the most tragic and this time hemingway was writing the story which still seemed to him moving and tragic which like all writers he never had told well enough to please him
this one was brought into urgency by the condition gap in tape that he was not really writing primarily about the spanish civil war but he was writing about the human condition which to him was moving and tragic in the terms of that war
does the writer write usually from urge or from a sense of
a little of both
i think that most writers are demon driven
whether to say that it she has to or or whether its an urge its difficult to say but he is driven by a demon that he has found this world amazing and and disturbing or tragic or comic or anyway passionate enough so that he has got to use the time he son earth to express maybe his appreciation of the fact that he lived for a little while maybe he s in away saying much obliged god that i was here for a while
it its a demon that he s driven by that does the writer ever get involved in more than one book at a time
oh yes
yes ive written one time i was working on three at one time
i have written a while on one and put it aside and then write another then comeback to the first one again
lets see
well have to start at the left
does the does the convict in the old manga in his strength from the fact that he does have the mind of a sixteen or seventeen year old and his perceptions are limited
noi wouldnt say he gained his strength from that
i would say that he gained his strength because he had a a very simple moral standard
that he made one aberration from it because he was tempted by delilah but he would he would never make that aberration again and he the he the reason for the security he wanted was that he would never be tempted he would believe that he wouldnt that his own strength would keep him from being taken over the hurdles by another womanlike that but he wasnt too sure
he knew as long as he was in that penitentiary and he was expiating the crime he did something wrong he knew that and he was expiating his crime
he was doing thebes the could to lead a decent life while he was there to expiate his crime against society
he had a standard of morals and that was i think his strength
he had been sent out to rescue two people in a flood and he did thebes the could to rescue both of them and bring them back that took a certain sort of morality to do that
he could have escaped at anytime but he didnt
do you condone his attempt to escape from his in security
i mean do you think its commendable to do what one wants eventhough its escape or do you think that one should try and better himself and should he have become a trustee and and attempted to face life more squarely
i think people should never judge one another least of all should the writer judge his characters
i think that man is trying to do better than he think she can maybe that he wants to be braver more honorable
he wants to have compassion
he she s afraid that maybe he wont that maybe he wont be as brave as he wants to be and then suddenly something happens and he finds to his astonishment that he was as brave as he wanted to be that he is as honorable as he wanted to be that he does have compassion so i would i would never judge him
i would i would say about him that within his lights to have accepted a condition and to do thebes the can in it whether that best is very intelligent or not is not too important
the fact is that by his light she s doing thebes the can in a condition
he s not whining to anybody
he didn task for for that condition but there it is and he s going to do the best in it
he s not going to whine and i think that s admirable
sir you have painted his fellow convicts as being almost animals they turn their backs to the rain and they crowd around the empty stove in the train and they they seem to have absolutely no personality
they re they re just animals
would the tall convict have been exactly the same
he would yes
that is the result of having been in prison
being in prison make saman an animal
what it divides deprives him of is the thing that differentiates him from beast which is the capacity for freewill for liberty freedom and so of course they were animals to turn their backs to a rain and and and hover over the symbol of of heat and warmth
that s the bad thing about prison about deprivation of simple liberty and freewill worst thing can happen to you
did you show that the convict had high moral standards in one sense by emphasizing the moral standards of charlotte and harry and
nono
i wasnt interested in the convicts moral standards anymore than i was interested in harry s and charlotte s
i was simply writing about people
i was writing the story of of a man and a woman who who threw away everything for love and the story wasnt wasnt emphasized it wasnt moving enough so i wrote the second story of of a man and a woman who got th everything that harry and charlotte had thrown away everything to have and wasnt happy until the man the convict got rid of it
i wasnt writing about their moral standards
they themselves exposed their moral standards tome simply by doing and saying things which i transcribe put down
sir when you write a book do you write just to or at a certain group of people because when a person starts reading your book his first shock as you said was the length of your sentences first of all and by the insight which is required to get to the meat out of the story to get the meaning that you want to convey
do you write to an above average class of people ori should say way above average class of people
noi dont think any writer does that
i know that in my own case i wrote books for years before it ever occurred tome that strangers might read them
the writer is demon driven
he is writing something which seemed to him so so moving so tragic so passionate that he had to put it down in his short span on this earth if for no other reason than to say i was here that he is not writing at at the time when the when the fire is hot and the demon has is really got him at a dead run for anybody
he s simply trying to put put this this passionate dream that he has seen or imagined down
later on he begins to realize that people do read it but at the time he he s not interested in that
he has nt thought about that
the first one wasnt good enough so he s busy writing another one
he has nt had time yet to realize that people will read it
judging from that sir you might say your idea your idea of a true author isnt one who sculpts his material toward the commercial side
that s right
yes if what he wants is money then there are probably easier ways to make money than being an author
i think that the young manor young woman that wants to write will have to make that choice
he has got to decided oi want to do this because i have a demon that wont let meal one or doi want to make some money at this
i think in the case of of the men and women who have been the good writers that choice never occurred to them that they had never had to stop to decide i have a choice to make now which shall i choose because he has made that choice
the alternative has never occurred to him anymore than he would choose now shall i be a writer or shall i be a banker
that if he wants to be a banker he will be a banker but he will be a writer too
if he wants to be a doctor he will be a doctor but if he has a demon to write he will still be a writer too
he will find plenty of time to be a writer be a painter be anything else
have you been approached and im sure you have to express yourself in a medium other than a book or a play
for instance have you ever been asked to write a television play or a movie that implies
well when i have needed money i have worked for moving pictures and television but that was simply a pleasant way to get a check every saturday night and it had nothing to do with writing
it was just a job
would you comment on drama as a literary form putting on the plays that perhaps were never meant for production
do you like this type of art
well i think that the play is or or the novel the short story that is a medium which fits the writers temperament best
it maybe that someone who thinks in term of of the drama sees more of what he wants to write than he hears maybe the man who or woman who instinctively takes the novel form hears voices rather than sees
that is a matter of of probably individual temperament and character which method is the one that you can can do what is to yourself the most satisfactory work which is the primary reason why the writer writes is for himself
i think that that all writers wanted to be poets maybe which is the highest form
then they would accept having failed to be poets to write the poetry which was as good as as they wanted it to be as they dreamed it to be
then he would take whatever medium is closest to his own nature and character which could be the stage or could be short stories or could be novels
i was just wondering one of your short stories arose for emily whatever inspired you to write this story
that tome was another sad and tragic manifestation of mans condition in which he he dreams and hopes in which he is in conflict with himself or with his environment or with others
in this case there was the young girl with a young girls normal aspirations to find love and then a husband and a family who was browbeaten and and kept down by her father a selfish man who who didnt want her to leave home because he wanted a housekeeper and it was a natural instinct repressed which which you cant repress it
you can mash it down but it comes up somewhere else in a very likely a tragic form and that was simply another manifestation of mans injustice to man of of the poor tragic human being struggling with its own heart with others with its environment for the simple things which all human beings want
in that case it was a young girl that just wanted to beloved and to love and to have a husband and a family and that purely came from your imagination
well the story did but the condition is there
it exists
i didnt invent that condition
i didnt invent the fact that young girls dream of of someone to love and children and a home but the story of what her own particular tragedy was was invented yes concerning a fable which i in my humble opinion is your greatest book although the critics didnt seem to think so what sir prompted you to write along those lines the history of a battlefield in france during the first worldwar and the mutinies in the french army and that was the only book i ever wrote that came from an intellectual idea purely and simply
it was the thought occurred tome who might that be under the splendid marble cenotaph with the eternal fire burning over it forever and forever
that if suppose that had been christ
if christ had had returned again of course he would have been crucified again which would be twice and maybe just maybe man would not be offered but one more chance
im sure that we all thankyou togo on but i wanted to give you an opportunity to no longer be subjected to questions
im sure that we all appreciate mr faulkner s coming and that we ve learned a great deal from his remarks
thankyou ladies and gentlemen
pickup from where he left off this morning what i would sort of like to ask you is after four months of contact with students at the university sort of what you feel in the rising generation whether we ve heard a lot of talk that they are very much driven toward conformity and security just the things i think that you probably would oppose in anyone who wanted to be a writer
but im thinking more of what you see in the students you ve talked to
tell me that again
i got lost
im sorry my sentence was involved
what i what im thinking of is what you what you think of the generations of students that you ve had contact with over the last four months here and possibly a year or so ago well lets limit it to the united states
are they more conventional than they were when they when you were their age
are they more seeking of conformity
what well what are they less intellectually curious
are they less daring
noi would say that they are more intellectually curious
they are more daring but they have more pressure to conform
there s there s more and more constant pressure to belong to something to be submerged into a mass that they have got to got to struggle with
but i would say that they are they are more curious than they were that they have more opportunities to be curious to know to keep up with what what cooks what does goon but there is that tremendous pressure to conform which i think they dont dont always realize is there well do you think most of them are resisting it
i would doubt it
i think that all young people resist it but there s no ordered resistance
they themselves dont dont realize how much and how constant that pressure is or that they would confederate against it
they are given too manythings that take the form of of bribery to not resist it to be unaware of it what sort of bribery
well the the pleasant things of of of existence of being a student the motorcars and the things that make the day by day life of a student simpler than it used to be when there was some question to keep warm in winter
you had togo to a little trouble to keep a fire going if nothing else there were it was a little more difficult to find pleasure
you couldnt go out and goto the theater by paying sixty or seventy cents at the moving pictures how every night
the books were not always available
and because things like that are available the student is the young man is tricked into not realizing the pressure on him to belong to a mass or a group which wants to do his thinking for him to give him the ideas that that group that of the overlords of the group and mass want him to have
but im convinced he still resists it and it breaks out in all sorts of of queer and unpredictable places what are they sir
well i think of young mr plow den wardlaw whose avocation seems to betaking part in a calypso band yet suddenly he and his friends on the magazine here have thought of that issue stating different notions about segregation that s interesting
he should they should do more with that
there should be more of that in the university i think than there is
but that s a very good a very hopeful symptom you said something about wishing that the university of virginia and the state of virginia would take more leadership in the south
you were asked that question the other night in conversation
well yes that s because of the respectful almost abject reverence which the rest of the south has toward the state of virginia and toward the university that when the state of virginia makes mistakes which should have been made not by virginia but by mississippi or alabama we area little ashamed do you have any mistakes in mind
well the unhappy business of the invitations they sent out for that dinner and they found that some of them had gone to negroes and they had to recall them that sort of thing
that s the sort of thing that you expect mississippi to do but not virginia
to the rest of the south virginia must be like caesars wife
last week you went to see a play written by one of the students here
i would be interested in any comments you would care to make on the play
hopeful
it was another instance of of of that pressure to conform
i think that asad and tragic thing a condition which the young writer today has to face is that the middle class has been broken down
it no longer exists as a homogeneous condition recognized by everyone everywhere
it exists but it exists as as you might say individual cells
the the best of the writing of the old days not so much done by members of the middle class but it was about the tragedies the problems which existed in the middle class and now there s no middle class anymore as a a definite condition recognizable everywhere to create those problems and so the plays have a flavor a little too preciously proletarian that they are concerned with conditions and not problems of the human heart
mr coffey s play showed a it was very hopeful i think
it it showed a sense of of his craft and it was very well done to have been done by amateurs because that was pretty difficult for amateurs to do that sort of thing to make it believable
you say the middle class but if there is no more middle class what do you think has happened to the middle class when there was one
conditions of overpopulation the confederation of the various labor unions which are are have transposed are transposing what was the proletariat into a new middle class i by the middle class having hard and fixed recognizable boundaries i mean that class which decreed that there should be banks as table currency
there should be churches
there should be schools
a class in which even the ones who couldnt cope financially were still supported by the middle class
they still belonged to it
now that class doesnt exist with the rigid boundaries so that when the ex member of it the member of what was the middle class has failed financially he is submerged
he is passed by people who rise through the old middle class without having learned any of the discipline the responsibility of their class of a middle class is part of that transition what you recorded in the town
well its what everybody writing records
i think its it definitely is a fact and every well people like the s nope ses always have risen risen in a country like this where there is freedom in which to make the best of your capacities but there was no middle class to give him a check probably he couldnt have risen as rapidly as he did fifty years ago when there was a definite and rigid middle class
im interested in something that seems to have happened to you
it seemed tome using the nobelprize as a mark in time rather than any special significance that you seem to have moved to a certain extent from communicating only through your works to well for example going to japan or coming to the university of virginia and going to other places for the state department
i wondered if this marked any sort of change or departure in your own thinking or sort of why you moved out
well sir you are constantly changing
your skin your fingernails is constantly changing
the the only alternative you know is death and lets hope that we wont have to keep on doing tomorrow what we are doing today there wouldnt be much fun in it
mr faulkner
in your talk to the students you said as i remember that its a question whether southern baptists are religious and i was wondering if you could elaborate on that and say if they are not religious then what are they
well they re laughter southern baptist
i think that is an an emotional condition that has nothing to do with god or politics or anything else what is involved in this emotional condition of the southern southern baptist
it came from from times of hardship in the south where there was little or no food for the human spirit where there were no books no theater no music and life was pretty hard
it a lot of it happened out in the sun for very little reward and that was the only escape they had
i think that is the human spirit aspiring toward something
of course it got warped and twisted in the process now this this condition do you limit that to southern baptists or do you visualize something larger than actually the baptist churches in the south
well i imagine that it exists almost everywhere though it may take other forms
it would exist wherever people have been starved spiritually starved
one other question can you have you gotten anything particularly out of this four months in charlottesville yourself and can you at this point in anyway distill sort of any feeling you might have about charlottesville and about the university
the writer writes from the three tanks i spoke of observation imagination and experience
he s got to constantly replenish them and fill them and so i couldnt say exactly what ive got from my my stay here to replenish those tanks though the tanks have been replenished because as as we agreed life is in constant flux in constant change and the time that you dont learn something new everyday you re dead based on your four months here i was wondering if your opinion of university education or college education has changed
as i understand when you first came here you said that a university a college education was good for some people and not not necessary for others and i was wondering if whether your opinion has been modified at all
no because ive had that opinion for about fifty years i think that all education in this country has got to be overhauled
i think that theresa its basically bad when when its premise is that everybody must be educated willy n illy that some people dont deserve to be educated and if everyone is to be educated unless enough money is spent on education to where the best student can have the best of the treatment the best of the education then he is going to have to be stultified and held back by a scheme which has got to take the one that is least fitted probably the ideal form of education would be one professor to one student or one professor to no more than ten students last week you were talking about the cultural interchange through the state department and wishing more of it could be done and done better
do you care to comment on that
i think my opinion is that we go about it the wrong way
we should stop trying to sell our country to europe or to anywhere else
we should bring the people that dont like our country to this country and let the malone and let them see what it is about it that makes us like it that its we we try to choose a people who are already our friends and then sell them some illusory picture of america
lets bring our enemies here
we we cant keep communist spies out of this country anyway
you might just as well bring all the communists that will come here and let them see what there is about this country that makes us like it not try to sell them anything
just let them see a country where everybody has a job and he can always hope for a cadillac
his children can goto the corner drugstore and and get an icecream cone everyday buy all the junk that americans love on the installment plan
mr faulkner do you think the thing that has broken down the middle class is materialism
no its the the terrific increase of population people that have got to be cared for that if we had spent as much attention to breeding people as we do to breeding horses and dogs we would ve had a better world probably and stayed out of a lot of trouble changing conditions
the machine is responsible for a great deal of it the machine that has given us more leisure than we have taught ourselves what to do with mr
faulkner you your statements that you think education should be overhauled and you said that you thought it would do good to if possible to have maybe one professor to one student or one toten students and that generally i believe is what colleges are trying to work for
now do you think they are on the right track generally or do you think they are making some mistakes and if so what mistakes
im sure that they are working toward something like that or maybe even a better idea and im convinced too that with with all the problems the the social problems which we face which is the leisure that we dont know what to do with with too many people with the need for housing that its amazing that the colleges advance as they do
that is if suddenly things could be stopped to give the colleges one year in which to make their plans they might do something but now they cant because here s another flux of of young men and women that have got togo to school and they dont have any chance to stop and get their breath and take stock and make plans what comparison if any can you make really between the japanese students you talked to at nagano and elsewhere and the ones you ve found here
i dont think that anyone can understand japanese so the impression i got could be completely wrong you see
the impression i got is that they are that their culture is a culture of of how to phrase it
of the functioning of the of the intellect not intelligence but of the intellect the little clicking of of of the wheels that turn and then just what it produces dont matter just so the all the little wheels are running constantly you ve made a comparison the other night of students different types of students in austria i believe isnt that true
well siri dont remember
ive done a lot of talking in these four months but you d have to look at the tape recorder to remember just what it was at the university of it would ve been at the university of vienna
i dont know
keep on
maybe ill remember it
with a group who were studying to whom you were talking in english were studying for foreign service and had definite ideas of what they wanted and so forth
they were much more seriously interested in
i dont know
can you help us out on that no sir
i dont recall that question or that answer
do you remember anymore of it mr ra nick
maybe well get to it in a minute no
it hati was asking partly trying to find what the answer was because i missed part of it
i was too far back in the room to catch it all
i remember you stated
in this cultural interchange you speak of wouldnt the student serve as well the student maybe and his family and the communists
how would you go about arranging something like that
i would import the whole family
the the first requirement would be that be communists
i would bring the whole family intact
i would arrange for labor to find a a job for him a house for him and schools for his children
let them stay two years and then send them back and then bring another intact family
yes to bring the father and the mother and and two or three children and not bother them at all
just let them see this country how it actually is instead of trying to give them the false phony picture which the people that put out our propaganda seem to think it is do you feel that if you had been born and grownup someplace else you would ve written pretty much the same kind of book laid in the environment there or do you think mississippi is particularly strong in bringing out these conditions in the human race
nono the imagination would be the same
the observation we would be different and assuming that the experience the books were were russian books or french books that would be a little different i mean but the people i write about are the same people
people have nt changed that much
the the locale is just incidental
the writer uses that because that s easier you wouldnt say there s anything significant about no about mississippi beyond no its just because its there
that s easier
if i wrote about another local eid have to do some research or risk somebody saying u huh that s wrong
do you feel you would have been influenced also probably to write the same type of thing
yes people are the same
people dont change that much
their problems are the same problems
you may have touched on this previously but could you give some advice to young writers
what advice would you give to young writers
at one time i thought the most important thing was talent
i think now that the young manor the young woman must possessor teach himself train himself in infinite patience which is to try and to try and to try until it comes right
he must train himself in ruthless intolerance
that is to throwaway anything that is false no matter how much he might love that page or that paragraph
the most important thing is insight that is to be to curiosity to wonder to mull and to to muse why it is that man does what he does
and if you have that then i dont think the talent makes much difference whether you ve got that or not how would you suggest that he get this insight
through experience
yes and then the greatest part of experience is in the bookstore ad to read and to read and to read and to read
to watch people to have to never judge people
to watch people what they do with with without intolerance
simply to learn why it is they did what they did
i believe earlier you were talking about reading when you were speaking to the class and a lot of it was about symbolism
you said since the writers cannot follow a lot of turns and corners the symbols and must get on with the writing and that s for the reader to followup
i was wondering when you did your reading did you follow the turns and the corners in in looking for symbolism
noi didnt
the the reader reads out of the same three reservoirs imagination observation and experience that the writer writes from
the the reader and the writer in the same culture have the same cultural background
that is the same religious symbols area part of of both backgrounds and its the writer by simple instinct will match those symbols and the old stories of his folklore for the reason that there re there re only two or three stories anyone can write and they are bound to repeat themselves
there re only a certain number of symbols which are the cultural background the spiritual background of anyone and of course they re going to appear when he begins to translate his own observation and imagination and experience on to paper
he will use the terms of his environment and apart of his environment is the symbolism which he inherited took in with his mothers milk you might say as apart of his own past of the long generations which which bought him toad and so its not surprising that they should all be there and its not surprising that he taking them for granted doesnt bother to see well here s where ive used a symbol and so i got this symbol how many years ago
that s not too important to him
its there
have you found any promising young writers during your stay here anyone who looks good for the future of fiction
any promising young writer tome is one that s really working at it
his promise will be in the work
the the symptom of promise is that he really is interested enough to accept the anguish and the frustration and the disappointment and and the final fun and and ecstasy of working at it so any young man that is sincerely working at it and sincerely interested in in the verities of mans condition shows promise
it may take him years before he lives up to that promise but if he s working at it that s all the promise he needs to give anybody what specifically in your memory did you you read that helped you more than anything else
everything i ever read from the telephone book up and down
trash
the good stuff
all of it it all and i think that no writer can say just how much influence he had from what source
that is he might be able togo back over his work and pick out pages or scenes or chapters that show show a derivation from a specific source but then the writer dont do that because by that time he s busy writing another book that he feels at at perfect liberty to take whatever he needs from whatever source he can find it just as he is perfectly willing to let anyone after him take whatever they can get from him with no jealousy whatever or no feeling that he has has what he he s amoral not immoral to return to the idea about about bringing in communists and and letting them live here and and see our way of life and and not bother them and well along that idea you said that usually you think they would return with a better picture of america than they re getting through our propaganda and i was wondering if you had any what kind of picture do you think they re getting now
it would be a true picture
i think the picture that they get from what we export is not a true picture of america because we want to be liked
we wanted to be thought well of and despite ourselves we dressup the image that we send abroad simply because we want to be liked and want to be thought well of but that a in t it
its to let them see themselves what it is in this country that makes us for some strange reason like it have you given this enough consideration that you would probably be tempted to write i reckon the only way i can live up to that en com i um is by going back to mississippi right away
there is a ridge you drive on beyond seminary hill and in time you come upon it a mild unhurried farm road presently mounting to cross the ridge and on to join the main highway leading from jefferson to the world
and now looking back and down you see ally ok napa taw pha in the dying last of day beneath you
there are stars now just pricking out as you watch them among the others already coldly and softly burning the end of day is one vast green soundless murmur up the northwest toward the zenith yet it is as though light were not being subtracted from earth drained from earth backward and upward into that cooling green but rather had gathered pooling for a nun moving moment yet among the low places of the ground so that ground earth itself is luminous and only the dense clumps of trees are dark standing darkly and immobile immobile out of it
then as though at signal the fireflies lightning bugs of the mississippi childs vernacular myriad and frenetic random and frantic pulsing not questing not qui ring but choir in gas if they were tiny incessant appease less voices cries words
and you stand suzerain and solitary above the whole sum of your life beneath that incessant ephemeral spangling
first is jefferson the center radiating weakly its puny glow into space beyond it enclosing it spreads the county tied by the diverging roads to that center as is the rim to the hubby its spokes yourself detached as god himself for this moment above the cradle of your nativity and of the men and women who made you the record and chronicle of your native land proffered for your perusal in ring by concentric ring like the ripples on living water above the dreamless slumber of your past you to preside un anguished and immune above this miniature of mans passions and hopes and disasters ambition and fear and lust and courage and abnegation and pity and honor and s in and pride all bound precarious and ramshackle held together by the web their on thin warp and woof of his rapacity but withal yet dedicated to his dreams
they are all here supine beneath you stratified and super posed os seo us and durable with the frail dust and the phantoms the rich alluvial river bottom land of old is set ib be ha the wild chickasaw king with his negro slaves and his sisters son called doom who murdered his way to the throne and legend said record itself said since there were old men in the county in my own childhood who had actually seen it stole an entire steamboat and had it dragged intact eleven miles overland to convert into a palace proper to ag grand is e his state the same fat black rich plantation earth still synonymous of the proud fading white plantation names whether wei mean of course they ever actually owned a plantation or not s ut pen and sartori s and comp son and edmonds and m cc asl in and beauchamp and grenier and haber sham and holston and stevens and de spain generals and governors and judges soldiers even if only cuban lieutenants and statesmen failed or not and simple politicians and overreach ers and just simple failures who snatched and grabbed and passed and vanished name and face and all
then the road less almost path less perpendicular hill country of mccallum and gowrie and frazier and muir translated intact with their pot stills and still speaking only the old gaelic and not much of that from culloden to carolina then from carolina toyo kpa taw pha still intact and still not speaking much of anything except that now they called the pots kettles though the drink even i can remember this was still us que ba ugh then and last on to where frenchman s bend lay beyond the southeastern horizon cradle of var ner s and an the ap of the northeast crawl of s nope s
and you stand there you the oldman already white headed because it doesnt matter if they call your gray hairs premature because life itself is always premature which is why it aches and anguishes and pushing forty only a few years from forty while there rises up to you proffered up to you the spring darkness the un sleeping darkness which although is it is of the dark itself declines the dark since dark is of the little death called sleeping
because look how eventhough the last of west is no longer green and all of firmament is now one un lidded studded slow wheeling arc and the last of earth pooled visibility has drained away there still remains one faint diffusion since everywhere you look about the dark panorama you still see them faint as whispers the faint and shapeless lamb en ce of blooming dogwood returning loaned light to light as the phantoms of candles would
and you the oldman standing there while there rises to you about you suffocating you the spring dark people d and myriad two and two seeking never at all solitude but simply privacy the privacy decreed and created for them by the spring darkness the spring weather the spring which an american poet a fine one a woman and so she knows called girls weather and boys luck
which was not the first day at all not eden morning at all because girls weather and boys luck is the sum of all the days the cup the bowl proffered once to the lips in youth and then no more proffered to quench or sip or drain that lone one time and even then that sometimes premature too soon
because the tragedy of life is it must be premature inconclusive and in con clu d able in order to be life it must be before itself in advance of itself to have been at all
there s no questions
not consent but anxious to do anybody likes to stand up in front of a lot of nice people and talk and nobody can say shut up and s it down
may i ask why in some of your writing that you use long such long sentences and almost eliminate punctuation i have in mind a case in point the first story in go down moses i think you call it was
the reason for that is i think that everyman every writer has a foreknowledge of death as everyone does
he realizes that he has only a limited time in which to do the work he wants to do
he has found being alive so amazing and so marvelous that he has got to transcribe it on to paper to shape it and he i think is trying to tell the whole passion of mans condition his hopes his fears his aspirations in the short time he has to live before he dies and so by instinct if he dont watch himself he tries to put everything into one long sentence like the like the man that used to inscribe all of the lords prayer on the head of a pin
that he must do it while he has breath to do it in
the pressure is not actually from the publisher
when i first thought of of these people and the idea of of a tribe of people which would come into an otherwise peaceful little southern town like like ants or or like mold on cheese then i discovered then that to tell the story properly would be too many words to compress into one volume
it had to be two or three
so the pressure has been on me before i ever told the publisher about it that i would have to keep on writing about these people until i got it all told and i assume that one more book will do it though i dont have any great hopes that it will mr
faulkner
do you write in regular hours or do you write in irregular hours
no sir
by nature iam completely disorderly
in ever have learned to hang up anything or put anything back where i got it and so iwork when well as the athlete says when im hot and i dont like to work
im by nature lazy
i will put it off as long as i can
then when i get started its its fun
i think the reason anyone writes is because its fun and you like it
that s just your cup of tea
and so i will write until i have to make myself stop because ive found that the only rule for writing i have is to leave it while im still hot while im still looking good as gentlemen prefer blondes puts it so that i can take up again tomorrow
but ive have never had any order
some people are orderly
they they layout a plot or synopsis first they make notes which is valid and satisfactory for them but not forme
i would be completely lost
probably if id begun to make a few notes i could say oh well that s all you dont need to work anymore an did quit so i think i put off working as long as possible and do as much of the research and the note filing up here and then begin to write
in your actual composition do you write everything out in longhand or do you type or have somebody i write it out in longhand because in ever have learned to think good on to the typewriter that ive got to got to feel the pencil and see the words at the end of the pencil
then if its the wrong word its simple enough to scratch it out and try it again
i reckon i was started writing too soon to have taken the typewriter as an extension of the hands as as the young man nowadays can do
i have to put put it down on paper first
after that ido there writing on the typewriter but something has got to be on paper first forme to look at and get the feel how fast do you dash it off sir
so fast that somebody said my handwriting looks like a caterpillar that crawled through an inkwell and out on to a piece of paper
if i leave it until tomorrow i can tread it myself so its got to be put down quick and then typed quick
how do you advantage to being pessimistic
well i think the writers aim is not deliberately to be pessimistic
his aim is to show people human beings in the human condition faced with the tragedies and the aspirations the hopes which all people are faced within the most moving way he can
if his outlook is pessimistic its simply because that is not not his intention to be pessimistic
its its because having watched people in their confusion and their aspirations that are what what he gets is an immediate feeling of pessimism though the very fact that he keeps on trying to write about people implies that that he has some hope for mantha the sees man as trying to do better than he does to be more honest than he is to be braver
that the pessimism is a matter of the moment
maybe the writer does want to do his bit toward making man better and maybe he thinks if he shows man in his moments of baseness it maybe be a lesson to someone either dont do this or or a reminder even when people dodo this at other times they do good things fine things
that they will do things that other people shan t suffer
do you always knowhow the books going to come out before you starting writing it
no siri dont
the the trick is to get the characters and and work at them until they stand on their own feet and take three dimensions and casta shadow and begin to move
after that all the writer has to do is to run along behind them with a notebook and put down what they say and do but he himself ori anyway dont know where they re going all i know is that they re alive and they re in motion and if i can keep up and write fast enough i wont miss anything
do you expect them to prove
only to the point that they area live and that the reader will believe that they area live
they may do things that shock him and outrage him and that he doesnt like but but my hope is hell say well they area live anyway they re scoundrels and rascals but they area live
that is the hope i think that any writer has that people he creates are credible that the comedy the tragedy they run into the silly things they do are things that are are within the scope of of a human being to do
yes sir yes ma am
when you wrote the sound and the fury why did you suddenly switch from the first person
that book began as as so many books do with with an anecdote a picture the picture was of both children who had been sent from the house
they didnt know why
something was taking place in the house in the parlor and like children they were curious to know what it was and the only one that was brave enough to climb the tree was the little girl and the book grew from that
it started off to be a simple short story
i wrote the first section which was the idiot brothers
i realized that that wasnt enough
i had nt told that story
soil et another brother try to tell it
that s the second section
i realized that still wasnt enough
i had nt told that story soil et the second brother try which was the third section
that still wasnt enough so then i had faulkner try it and and still it was not enough
i still have nt told the story to suit me
that s the reason that tome is the one i love the dearest that im the most fond of because that was the most splendid failure and i still have nt told that story i believe that if i had it to do over i could do it better
of course i wouldnt
but that s the one book i wish i had nt written so i could write it now
you ve spoken frequently i believe about various ways that you ve failed giving us the impression that you you never feel as if you ve quite expressed yourself is it really so hard
that s right
i think that s true of any writer
that s why he writes another book
if he wrote the book that pleased him absolutely that was perfect by his own standards then nothing remains but to cut his throat but that book fails so he writes another one
he believes that the next one wont fail of course it will
which is good for him because that keeps him working and i think that no life is as happy as as a life in which you ve tried to make something which wasn there before a picture or a symphony or a book or a piece of sculpture and that is tome the best life of all
not a happy life because its filled with with anger frustration because its not perfect of rage and exhaustion but its its really a matchless life
i wouldnt put any other occupation above it
i think that a man that can ded a young man young woman who can dedicate himself or herself to that simple idea to make something which didnt exist before it is the best life mr
faulkner
may i ask how much your daily variations of mood affect the actions of your characters
suppose one day you getup feeling fine do your characters seem to take on a cheerful aspect
i dont believe so
i think that anyone the painter the musician the writer works in a kind of an an insane fury
he s demon driven
he can getup feeling rotten with a hangover or with with actual pain and and if he gets to work the first thing he know she dont remember that pain that hangover he s too busy
that his feeling i doubt if that reflects too much in his work
that he can wake up and goto work feeling good and the first thing he know she doesnt remember whether he feels good or no the s too busy that he is in the in the clutch of a demon then
does that mean that he also impervious to atmosphere
nono
i think the writer any artist is completely amoral he s robs and steals everywhere he can find anything he might need
the atmosphere he hashes gathered up from observation from experience just from living and breathing
he stole that away and then when he needs it to put into what he write she hunts around in his trash bin or his lumber room and picks out the atmosphere or the symbolism or the style whatever he needs but he has has acquired that long before he sits down to write
at the time he s writing he s like the carpenter building a fence or a chicken coop that he s busy sawing planks and driving nails that he has already go this supply of nails and his boards at hand where he can reach back into his workshop and get what plank or what size nails he needs
as far as i know they do because the friends i have are are not literary friends
they are people engaged in other pursuits and unless im as good in their pursuits as they are they have of course a low opinion of mei fim as good in in their pursuits that is farming or hunting or with horses as they are then they have a high opinion of me which has nothing to do with my books because they dont read my books
some artist said that nobody in mississippi reads they re all writing
i want to ask you a question about the town
the the heroine of this story eu lava rner s nope s at the end commits suicide
what do you think was her reason for it
it was for the sake of that child
she at that time had realized that every child a young girl especially needed the semblance of an intact home that is to have a mother and a father to have the same things that the other children had
and she had reached an impasse where where her her lover would have demanded that she leave her her husband and then that child would have found out that it had grownup in a broken home
up to this time whether the child loved fl em or not atleast he was the symbol of the father which all the other children had and with the mother felt it would be better for this girl to have a mother who committed suicide than a mother who ran off with a lover which was that may have been the wrong decisions he made but that was the decisions he did make that atleast this girl would ve would ve had the simi li tude of an intact though a tragedy tragedy ridden home just as other children did do you by chance have in mind writing the story of this daughter now
yes sir
that will be in the in the next book
she s one of the most interesting people ive written about yeti think
her story will be in the next book
how do you feel about the use of symbols
that seems to be quite therage now
do you consciously use symbols in your writing
not deliberately
the the symbolism is apart of anyone s past
by i mean by that his environment his background his experience his observation
and apart of that background is the christian religion
the writer is engaged primarily in in writing about people
he s doing this in the most moving and most effective way he knows and the symbolism like the style they are the nails and the boards in in the carpenters workshop and these symbols appear almost by coincidence in what he does
he s simply writing out of his own background of observation and experience that he has nt got time to say now im going to use a symbol
he s too busy writing about simple men and women engaged in in the tragedy of mans condition engaged in the conflict with the human heart or with its fellows or with its environment its background and i think that the reader must read any book from the same background which the writer writes it from that is from the background of observation experience and imagination and so the reader reads into the book finds in the book symbolism which the writer didnt know was there and is not really interested in finding there
he was too busy but he doesnt doubt that that symbol symbolism is there or even if it were not what symbolism is there could be translated into someone else s understanding and comprehension
that is a chinese could probably find chinese symbolism in an american book just as the american can find american symbolism in a chinese or a japanese book mr
faulkner yes m
i heard of your article in ebony magazine giving advice to the colored people as to the way they should act toward integration
what was your advice and do you think that they are heeding it in anyway
i would like to think that some do
the advice was simply that no law or edict passed by no matter whom is going to change the social condition until the people involved in that condition wish it changed
that is if the negro were given equality by a police force he would keep that equality only as long as the police stood there
when the police were gone then someone smarter or more ruthless would take it away from them again that he has got to earn that equality
he has got to learn as everybody must that liberty and freedom is not a condition like rainfall or sunshine or being too cold or being too hot
that s a condition that one must must work to gain and then work to hold that to keep equality and freedom you must learn the responsibility of equality and freedom that nobody can have the freedom given him by the police until he swilling to deserve it and then work to keep it which is to be responsible for it
and ido hope that some people in the negro race read it and believed in it and and will take heed to it since its a problem which has got to be solved as we we cant cant deport the whole negro race
he s apart of our country now and and we must all the whiteman and the negro too must work together to make his condition bearable otherwise its its like having seventeen million mules running loose in the country
it seems you have placed the negro in an inferior position i have not placed him in an inferior position
its the the whole white race and white economy has placed him in an inferior position economically and educationally because in in that position the whiteman s revenues from his economy will be a little higher
its not that the negro we dont know whether the negro is inferior to the whiteman or not
he s had no chance to be anything else but i as i see i the must have the chance to prove whether he is inferior or not that he is not going to be content any longer to be inferior
i mean artificially inferior
he s got to have the chance to prove that he is equal or incapable of it and its better to for the whiteman to give him that chance than to have that chance foisted on the whiteman by law
the state of the negro was forced upon him by law was it not
well siri would say by custom and then of course all our law is or usually is it speaks after the fact
the law simply makes legal what has been a custom
the law dont change what he means and probably any story that cant be told in one sentence or atleast one paragraph is not worth writing the the revision the cutting out in my own case im lazy
i dont like to work and so i will do as much of it as possible in in the mind in thinking before i undertake the arduous hateful job of swatting it out on paper
i think the revision quite often follows because when the job is down on paper at last it still is not quite what it should be and so you you you change you revise you edit you you try to bring it closest to the ideal of perfection which of course you re not going to reach either
that is what im trying to say is that the revision is i think for the writer more than than the editors revision which is for the reader yes do you work so to speak eight hours a day at a desk and just concentrate on it all day long or do you just sort of let it come to you and work spasmodically
oh i think that the writer never quits working
all the time he s awake in as is ayin my own case i put off the actual work as long as possible but probably all the time im awake im thinking about the particular jobim at at the time and iwork at it only when i have to
the only rule i have is to quit while its still hot
never write yourself out always quit when its going good
then its easier to take it up again
if you exhaust yourself then you ll get into a dead spell and you have trouble with it
its what s the saying leave them while you re looking good
did you have a question thomas yes im particularly interested in your style and i would like to know have you developed it consciously and has it changed very much since when you first began to write
i did not develop it
i think style is one of the tools of the craft and i think anyone that spends too much of his time about his style developing a style or following a style probably has nt got much to say and knows it and is afraid of it and so he writes a style a marvelous trove
he becomes walter pater which is beautiful but there a in t too much in it i think style is simply one of the tools of the craft
that that the story you retelling commands its style that one style is good for now and another style will be good for tomorrow and and like the good carpenter one should should be able to well you might say almost imitate that there s something s that certain men have women writers have told better than others have which is a good tool to use if you retrying to give the same effect that that manor woman gave but the style is incidental i think in other words its intuitive
that s right yes
that the story commands its style and in away creates its style
but you rewriting primarily about people
do you think that a writer can teach young writers
i dont think anybody can teach anybody anything i think that you learn it but but the young writer that is as i say demon driven and and wants to learn and has has got to write he dont know why he will learn from from almost any source that he finds
he will learn from older people who are not writers he will learn from writers but he learns it
you cant teach it
then i think too that the that the writer who s actually hot to say something has nt got time to be taught
he s too busy learning
he knows what he wants
his instinct says to take this from this manor that from that man but he s no the has nt got time to s it under a mentor and listen to try to learn
to get back to the business of style for just a minute
you mentioned in some class that i attended that dostoevsky and conrad were two people you read a good deal when you were eighteen and nineteen years old
would you say that you had gotten something in the way of arrangement of words from conrad
every now and then in your stories i was thinking of a couple of passages in the bear passages here and there in other stories there are arrangements of cadence rhythm that seems tome to be rather like conrad
im thinking of a passage in you than arrangement of adjectives resplendent yet somber full of danger yet promising
its the description of the east when that young boy comes upon it
there s something of the same kind of use of those kind of kind of heavy arrangement of adjective sive noticed in your writing
does that seem fair
quite true
i got quite a lot from conrad and i got quite a lot from a man that probably you gentlemen young people never heard of a man called thomas beer
you you probably know the name i know the name thomas beer in connection with a critical work
did he write the mauve decade
he wrote the yes yes that show i got to and i got quite a lot from him
it was tome a good tool a good good method a good usage usage of words approach to an incident
i think the writer a sive said before is completely amoral
he takes whatever he needs wherever he needs and he does that openly and honestly because he himself hopes that what he does will be good enough so that after him people will take from him and they are welcome to take from him as he feels that he would be welcome by the best of his predecessors to take what they had done
do you think the writer is asking for trouble if he attempts to write of things beyond his personal experience
no siri do not
ido not
there should be no limits to what the writer tries to write about
he has got to tell it in terms that he does know that is he can write about what is beyond his experience but the only terms he does know are within his experience his observation but there should be no limits to what he attempts
the the higher the aim the better
if he wants to be a failure well let him be a fine bust not just a petty little one sir back to your writing often it seemed tome that you choose questions and then answer them yourself as you develop your story rather than letting the reader answer them letting them togo unanswered
is that a lack of confidence in your reading audience or merely a trick of style
it its not a conscious trick and im sorry that that word occurred to anyone about it
it its the the desire to exhaust completely the human character which one is trying to create to probe and to probe and to probe to never be quite satisfied
the man with judgment will have enough of it that after he has probed and probed to get the absolute essence to have the taste and the judgment to edit it then to throwaway a lot of it but sometimes he doesnt always do that
it maybe lack of taste
it maybe his hurry
it maybe that he himself thinks that this is necessary so that who reads it can follow him that he has probed and probed and probed to get to the absolute bottom of the character he s trying to create
i dont believe that ive ever used that as a trick
i may have
its its hard to say
as i say the writer is amoral about other peoples work and quite often about himself
he is a congenital liar or he wouldnt be a writer and maybe he cant tell the truth about anything
this is sort of long question
in last weeks issue of the new york times book review colin wilson discussed the great making s of a great writer and he said writers today are of two kinds what he termed telescopic and microscopic the telescopic writer being one that gives a birds eye an extended view of nature and the microscopic writer being one who examines the life of ordinary people
he went on to say that a great writer combines these two qualities and examines himself at the sametime and finally he said that your writing and that of dos passos williams and miller were all microscopic and he went on to say third rate my question is do you agree with his statements of the making s of a great writer and if not what do you think makes a great writer
i think the question about telescopic writing and microscopic writing that s a literary question and is in mr wilsons provenance but probably not in the provenance of a writer unless that writer is also literary
i dont think that you have to be literary just to be a writer i want to set the record straight
i dont think you quoted him quite exactly joseph
i think he said people who imitated those writings were third rate writers
i think that colin wilson seems a very brash person but i dont think he s inclined to be that brash do you
no
i think its the imitators he s thinking of
well that is resembles something that we just spoke about is that someone who has nt got anything to say he knows if he has the desire to write will imitate for the sake of imitation
he will think hemingway has written good books so ill write like hemingway which is the third rate writer in the sense that he has nt gotten something first rate to say and probably never will have
actually i thought at one time that what one needed to write with is talent but i think now its probably patience to probe and to try and to probe and to try then ruthlessness to discard what is not necessary or what is trashy but mostly what you need is insight which is the probing that you dont need to have a telescopic eye nora microscopic eye its its insight the desire to see why man does what he does mr
faulkner in doing that do you find that you ve done it yourself
oh yes
that s that s like we spoke of of one has got to to write in the terms that he knows which is his own environment and and mans closest environment is his himself
that he has got to measure everything against what he believes and feels to be true
now his belief has has come from observation from experience from what he has read mostly a lot from what he s read but he yeshe s got to measure everything against what he himself believes not thinks up here but believes here to be be true and be moving
a lot of people have said that your novels and short stories contain many hidden meanings and subtle symbolism s and things like that do you find that they more or less as you as you write do they all fit some preconceived design of yours or the symbolism or the hidden meanings more or less develop as you write or do you find that people sometimes read more into your stories than you yourself originally intended for them to read
i wouldnt say that they do
they they read into my stories lots of things which i myself didnt know were there but im sure that they requite right when they can find symbolism
the the symbolism the pattern of symbolism is apart of of the man the individual too and he s still writing in terms of his environment and that s part of his environment
the the religious symbolism the mythological symbolism the rest of it is all that he has robbed andre ft and stolen as he read and grew up and listened and he s still writing in the terms which he knows because it simplifies things
could you tell me what do you think that conrad was trying to say or what he means to you as an author
yes
what they all mean tome is to write about man in conflict with himself his own heart or with his fellows or with his environment
i think that the writer that is trying to deliver some sociological or some topical message is in retrograde toward the second rate that primarily the writer is writing about people in conflict and the social message is incidental
the social message is part of the environment which he uses as a tool
sir speaking of symbolism in your story that evening sun why did you name that fellow jesus
that was probably a deliberate intent to shock just a little
that s a its a valid name among negroes in in mississippi
that is you dont see it too often but its its nothing unusual its not uncommon but there may have been a little not so much to shock but to emphasize the point i was making which was that this this negro woman who had given devotion to the white family knew that when when the cris of her need came the white family wouldnt be there
how serious were you in the preface to sanctuary when you said that you were writing for to the reader instead for yourself as you had in your other books
well that s along story
i wrote sanctuary
i needed money badly at that time and so i thought of the most horrific story i could and wrote it
i sent it to the publisher and he said good god we cant print this
wed both be in a jail
and i was glad of it because by that time i had got a job and didnt need the money and i wrote two other books
they were printed and the none day i got the galley for sanctuary and i looked at it and i didnt need the money by that time and it was a base shoddy shabby job and so i wrote the publisher to throw the whole thing out that we wouldnt print it and he he wrote me back that plates had been made he didnt have much money at that time either
he had money invested in this and something must be done and i said well ill rewrite it then and make it do the best i can to make it a decent honest book
and he said well all right
ill agree to that and ill pay half the cost of the new plates and you pay half
so i had to get another job to earn the two hundred and seventy dollars to pay my share of the new plates and i rewrote the book and did the best i could with it to make it make it an honest book and i was still ashamed of that first attempt because that was the only time i ever betrayed well call it them use you might say and i was so ashamed of it and when i wrote that preface i still didnt like the book and i still am sorry that i wrote the first version of it and that was the reason for the preface when did you first realize that you wanted to write sir
i think i had scribbled all my life ever since i learned to read
i wrote poetry when i was a young man until i found that i that it was bad poetry would never be first rate poetry
and i was i was in new orleans
i worked for a bootlegger
this was in
iran a launch from new orleans across pontchartrain down in the industrial canal out into the gulf where the schooner from cuba would bring the raw alcohol and bury it on a sandspit and wed digit up and bring it back to the bootlegger and and his mother she was she was an italian
she was a nice little old lady and and she was the expert
she would turn it into scotch with a little creosote and bourbon
we had the labels the bottles everything
it was quite a quite a business
and i met sherwood anderson
he was living there and i liked him right off and we would we got along fine together
we would meet in the evenings in the afternoons wed walk and he d talk an did listen
wed meet in the evenings and wed goto a drinking place and weds it around till one or two o clock drinking and still me listening and him talking
then in the morning he would be in seclusion working and the next time id see him the same thing we would spend the afternoon and evening together the next morning he dbe working
and i thought then if that was the life it took to be a writer that was the life for meso so i wrote a book and when i started i found that writing was fun and i had nt seen mr anderson in sometime till i met mrs
anderson on the street
she said we have nt seen you in along time what s wrong
i said im writing a book
and she said do you want sherwood to look at it
and i said nom its not finished yet
i had nt thought of anybody looking at it
it was fun to write the book
and is a wher later and she said it old sherwood you were writing a book and he said good god
then he said that he he will make a trade with you
if he dont have to read i the will tell his publisher to take it
i said done
and so that was how my first book got published and by that time id found that writing was fun
i liked it that was my cup of tea an dive been at it ever since and will probably stick at it
sir what gave you the idea for your short story mountain victory
it i believe as i remember that came from the idea of the let me see
i believe it was the idea of the irreconcilable difference between two men of more or the less the same background the eastern tennessee mountain man who was a southerner too and the descendant of a slave owning aristocracy to meet in those conditions never to be bek in yet never to touch
in away both victims of the war
probably that s what it came from
i dont remember
i was still writing about people and as i recall that would might ve been
i just dont know
so much so much of your material seems to be connected
is there anyway you determine what is short story material and what is novel material
no the story itself does that
in ever know myself which its going to be
the sound and the fury i thought was going to be a short story
i think it would take a much better craftsman than iam a more trained craftsman maybe a more literary craftsman to know beforehand what form the material wants to take
im simply writing about people that i begin when i can and stop as soon as i can i remember asking you a question the other day about two stories one called two soldiers a story that i like very much and some of the people in my class have read and what i consider a sequel to that story called the country will she shall survive
i think that sits it or oh shall not perish
shall not perish
that s it
it seems tome that theresa difference between the two stories in away
the first story i can read over and over again with a great deal of pleasure and interest
the second story seems tome to be something of a dead thing in comparison to the first and i think you started to tell me the other daywhen i was speaking of it the first story had to do with peoples character and the second story really had to do with an idea
that s right
the the first story had to do with one of the most interesting of all conflicts all human conflicts
tome its its the boy trying to reconcile to learn in order to accept the adult world he will have to cope with and i believed more in the story about the little boy and his brother who got drafted than i believed in the in the idea that i tried to make into another story the sequel to it do you feel that s why the second story may not seem as that s right
that im simply not an idea many es
a sim not not really interested enough in ideas to take even my own too seriously
from what viewpoint did you write the you write the story from i believe it was from these thirteen it was called carcassonne or carcassonne
that was i was still writing about a young man in conflict with his environment
i it seemed tome that fantasy was the best way to tell that story
to have told it in terms of of simple realism would have lost something in my opinion
to use fantasy was the best and that s a piece that ive always liked because there was the poet again
i wanted to be a poet and i think of myself no was a failed poet not as a novelist at all but a failed poet who had to take up what he could do
sir in connection with that there san old french poem by the name of carcassonne
i forget the author
it has pretty much the general the same sort of theme
i wonder if that was in your mind at the time
i dont know the poem though if i did know it and i had needed to steal from it im sure i would
i wouldnt have hesitated
what do you mean in your story all the dead pilots and i believe a story called honor in which you give the impression that those people who fought in the war after those experiences of war will be dead the rest of their lives
well in a in away they were
that the ones that even continued to live very long were the exceptions and the one among them that coped with the change of time or you can count them on your thumbs almost
rickenbacker s one but there are not too many others
bishop he finally drank himself to death died last year and the others victory eats didnt live ten years
but then in away they they they were dead they had exhausted themselves psychically whatever it was but anyway they were unfitted for the world that they found afterwards
not that they rejected they simply were unfitted they had worn themselves out you d restrict that feeling to people who had been in aviation not with people who had served in other branches of the armed services
at that time yes because there was more concentration of being frightened of flying then than in infantry or or ground troops
you just got got scared worse quicker and more often yes
flying than you did on the ground
you seem to distinguish between literary men and and writing men
i was wondering if you would elaborate on that
are not the two reconcilable
cannot they be
yes i think i said that some writing men are literary men but i dont think that you have to be a literary man to be a writer
i think that to be a literary man infers a certain amount of of well even formal education and there are some writers that have never had formal education
of course you can be literary without the formal education but ive ive got to talk in terms of what i know about faulkner now you see and sherwood anderson that we were not literary men in the sense that edmund wilson is a literary manor malcolm cowley for instance mr
faulkner sorry
what short story writers at the present time do you find interesting people from the point of view of their of their stories something that people might read with profit
may i have that again what short story writers do you admire at the present time
now that s a difficult question forme because i think not of writers but of the characters
i remember the characters they wrote about without being able to remember always just just who wrote the wrote the piece
but when i was a young man thomas beer that i mentioned he influenced me a lot
chekhov
i cant think of some of the others what about the present writers in your area of the country a writer like eudora welty
well i think again of of the books rather than the writer yes
i think of a book of her s called the robber bridegroom which was quite different from any of the other things she has done which tome was the worthwhile one
i think of of stories of of hemingway
i wouldnt say that i like all of hemingway but i remember stories of his that have nt been matched in my time though i can think of of people that have written better better pages better paragraphs than hemingway
i can think of of stories of of erskine caldwell
i have always rated thomas wolfe first among my lot because of of the failure the splendor of his failure as compared to the not quite splendor of of our failures but i would never read wolfe again
it would its still a a magnificent failure but i would never read it again and i remember very little of what i did read from wolfe but i remember characters from hemingway
i remember characters from caldwell but not from wolfe did you want to aska question what importance do you attach to the titles of your stories and books and how do you go about selecting them
i think a title is extremely important to a book and i think that a gift for choosing titles is a mark of genius i think that balzac the the way he chose titles that was genius an dive been been quite lucky in the title sive chosen but some of them have been wrong but but most of them have been pretty good titles i think
when you set out to write a book do you usually knowhow you re going to reconcile your characters in the end or how the plot is going to workout or do you let this work itself out for itself as you go along
after about the third or fourth page the characters take charge of that book
they write the rest of it
they just tell me what to put down mr
you had a question it was almost the same question but what happens do you ever feel the characters particularly one do you feel a necessity to give every character
do you tell all the truth about that character that you feel needs to be told regardless of whether
noi think that after about ten books i had learned enough of of judgment to where i could pick and choose the facet of a character which i need at that particular time to move the story i was telling so that i can can take a facet of one character in one story and and another facet of that character in another story
tome its the same character though sometimes to the reader it may seem as though the character had changed or had developed more
tome he has nt
that i used my editorial prerogative of choosing what i needed from that particular character at that particular time in light of that when you think about the failure of thomas wolfe do you feel that there is any connection with the necessity the way you feel about how characters
if i understand it right im sure that wolfe felt the same way that i did about his editorial right to choose what he wanted from the character in order to tell what he was trying to tell
to tom ewha time an by the splendor of wolfe s failure is that everyman will will live only a short time his biblical threescore and ten
he knows that that in time soon very soon or comparably he will begone finished and done and his only chance is a very limited one limited one in which to express all living or earth anguish or hope aspiration has meant to him is in the short space he will have and he is in away trying to write the whole history of the human heart on the head of a pin
hell have only one shot at it and that s what i mean by the splendor of wolfe s failure that he tried hardest with the most courage to put the whole history of mans heart on the head of the pin
and that was your ambition yes
how much do you feel that the writers being involved with people in his writing is dependent upon his being actively involved with real people in the real world
i think that has nothing to do with the writing
that he can be involved with people he can be involved with alcohol or with gambling or anything and its not going to affect the writer
now i have no patience and i dont hold with the mute inglorious milton s
i think if he s demon driven with something to be said then he s going to write it
he can can blame his the fact that he s not turning out the work on lots of things ive heard people say well if i were not married and and had children i would be a writer
ive heard people say if i could just stop doing this i would be a writer
i dont believe that
i think if you re going to write you re going to write and nothing will stop you
that you can be involved and probably the more you re involved it maybe better for you
that maybe its its bad to crawl off into the ivory tower and stay there that maybe you do need to be involved to get the edges beaten off of you a little everyday maybe good for the writer mr
faulkner in the story red leaves the slave escapes from his indian captors and goes and hides in the swamp and in order to avert his capture has the cottonmouth strike him in the arm
then the indians come and capture him anyway and why did this happen in the story
is this to show that man cant escape his condition or
no that was the snake episode was to show to show that man when he know she s going to die thinks that he can accept death but he doesn the doesnt really
the negro at the time he he said im already dead it doesnt matter the snake can bite me because im already dead but yet at the end he still wanted to put off that man will cling to life that in a preference between grief and nothing man will take grief always
in the next to last chapter of light in august you have the scene where high tower is considering manythings past life in particular and there is the vision that he sees of the dead face of the dead christmas and as he sees it it begins struggling trying to resolve itself into a different focus and while i think i know what that scene means tome would you care to comment on your meaning there
yeshe was a man of god who had had failed always
he in his belief was that he had failed his wife that if he had been different his wife wouldnt have gone bad that here was a time when a man of courage would ve saved this man and he the man of god failed again and so he resorted into fantasy to dream when when some high tower was brave and gallant and courageous that it was escape that he hated himself i have often wondered did you mean in that scene that he is approaching death
is he suffering a heart attack there that he is dying in that chapter
no
no he wished he could die
no he didnt
he would have to suffer a little longer than that
many writers beginning to write usually in their first work make one of their characters usually the hero animage of himself
now i dont find this true in in your writings at all
but may i ask you do you ever find yourself identifying with one of your characters and have to resist for instance someone like gavin stevens or just for the moment say the oldman in the last pages of a fable who comes out of the crowd
i dont know whether anyone could say any writer could say just how much he identifies himself with his characters
quite often the young man will write about himself simply because himself is what he knows best
that he is using himself as the standard of measure and to simplify things he writes about himself as perhaps as he presumes himself to be maybe as he hopes himself to be or maybe as he hates himself for being
though after that the more the more you write the more you you see you have to write the more you have learned by writing and probably you dont really have time to identify yourself with a character except at certain moments when the character is in a position to express truthfully things which you yourself believe to be true
then you ll put your own ideas in his mouth but they when you do that they ll become his
i think that you re not trying to preach through the character that you re too busy writing about people
it just happens that this man agrees with you on this particular point and so he says it
you seem to say that a writer should write of the heart and im assuming that also this is an assumption that you believe that a writer should write from the heart no was opposed to writing from the of the heart there s writing of the glands which you ve mentioned before
may a writer successfully write from the glands rather than from the heart
he can successfully do it like what s his name
spillane and the toughs theme but its not its not good writing
its not worth doing in my opinion
its successful but it a in t worth doing i what i meant to write from the heart is its its the heart that has the the desire to be better than man is the the up here can know the distinction between good and evil but its the heart that makes you want to be better than you are
that s what i mean by to write it from the heart
that its the heart that makes you want to be brave when you are afraid that you might be a coward that wants you wants you to be generous or wants you to be compassionate when you think that maybe you wont
i think that the intellect it might say well which is the most profitable
shall i be compassionate or shall i be un compassionate
which is most profitable
which is the most profitable
shall i be brave or not
but the heart wants always to be better than man is
was the rose for emily an idea or a character
just how did you go about that
that came from a from a picture of the strand of hair on the pillow
it was a ghost story
simply a picture of a strand of hair on the pillow in the abandoned house
you seem to find the easiest message for writing as a kind of easy first person with his message or something of that sort
you re always there in your stories is my hunch
yes that s the easiest simplest method of doing it
yes is that how you started out in your first stories from that point of view
no
i was still trying to talk about people in the simplest way i could think of and i myself probably never did decide now shall this be told in the first person or the third person or how
i was simply talking about trying to tell about people trying to create a man which would have the solidity of of a living man that is would be capable of anguish and and courage and compassion or baseness be human so that he too would throw a shadow behind him not a transparency that the others are just a matter of which tool to use its its not not too important
you say you re interested in and have been throughout your writing in people rather than ideas
im just wondering as you were saying that about for example a book like the fable at what point did the allegory did you become conscious of it
obviously you didnt take the idea and impose it i gather from what you say
what got you into the fable what what that was tour de force
it the notion occurred tome one day in shortly after pearl harbor and the beginning of the last great war
suppose who might that unknown soldier be
suppose that had been christ again under that fine big cenotaph with the eternal flame burning on it that he would naturally have got crucified again and i had to then it became tour de force because i had to invent enough stuff to carry this notion you were writing from an idea then
that s right that was an idea and a hope that a nun expressed thought that christ had appeared twice had been crucified twice and maybe wed have only one more chance
yes
as you started had you ever read a book called the paths of glory
yes
well that was his book too was based on an actual instance in the french records
there was a regiment that refused and also that book i did use when it became tour de force i had to use all the symbolism i could think of and i was using the trinity of of mans of mans spirit the one the the young british pilot who said this is evil
i wont accept it i will decline the world before i will accept it
the old general who said this is evil but we can bear it
the runner who said this is evil im going to do something about it
they have anyone have anyone more question you want to ask because well have to stop pretty soon
we got classes coming on
anybody want to aska question thankyou very much for coming into this classroom
its been very nice indeed having you
thankyou
thankyou gentlemen
change the negros condition that the negros condition was gradually being changed by the by the whiteman
he was being given more and more of liberty more and more of equality
that supreme court decision in mississippi anyway has has set things back for the reason you say that you cannot legislate against against the more s and against a social condition
you can only state that the social condition is bad and must be changed but you cant change it overnight bypassing laws
well id say that in mississippi the may decision was not implemented but it did move mississippi to try and implement plessy vs
fergusson
the schools separate but equal
well they had been moving in that direction for sometime
they had not moved fast enough
and if there had been no supreme court decision the white people in mississippi would ve been content with the infinitesimal progress they were making
the supreme court decision only warned them that they must move faster or something must be done but it still has not changed the situation in mississippi
it has speeded up a gradual evolution but it has nt changed overnight any situation there well my point is if it did accelerate even in mississippi then it is laws that make effects
well yes
it was a statement which had effect
that was a decision
that wasnt a law
it was simply a decision on on the law which the supreme court made
it had nt changed the law in mississippi mr
faulkner
going back to your symbolism you said that the symbol when you rewriting would mean one thing to one reader and perhaps another to another reader
when you write are you ever conscious of writing for a certain group of readers
do you ever write and then decide well this wont be as good and ill change it
nono
i think the writer writes for himself
in fact i wrote for years before it occurred tome that strangers might read what i was writing that the writer writes for himself
he s trying to make something perfect which wasn there before
when he begins to temper what he writes to who will read it then i think the writing itself suffers but he has got to observe certain rules of of coherence but he is writing primarily to depict the world man struggling in his condition as he himself saw it that he has seen man in his condition struggle against it in his aspirations his follies his hopes his tragedy which to that writer was so moving that he himself has got to put that down on paper to capture what to him was magic
it maybe though he is not writing for glory it maybe that he knows all the time that someday after his allotted span he will pass through the last wall of oblivion and maybe what he s actually doing is simply writing on that wall k il roy was here
mr faulkner what do you think of exaggeration as a literary device
i think its its valid just like fantasy just like comedy just like tragedy just like in version
they are are valid in the sense that the carpenters tools are valid
whatever the carpenter wants to use which in his opinion will build the best chicken coop is valid he may decide to use his hammer backward or to saw with with a kitchen knife but anything that to him is the best tool he can use to make the chicken house as near perfect as he can make it is valid
i think that noone should should write just to be funny or just to be fantastic ill take that back
he he is perfectly at liberty to write just to be funny or just to be fantastic but i think the one the man that s doing that is like the man that writes primarily to be a stylist that he has nt got a whole lot to say that what he has to say is not valid and urgent in the sense of depicting man in his struggle with himself with his fellows with his environment mr
faulkner
i think they re restatements
actually there re only three subjects to write about love money and death
people writers write about men and women in the tragedy of the human condition and the verities which man struggles with are are eternal
they have nt changed much and his problems are new only in that they are new and novel to that individual just like to the young man and young woman there never was love before like ours like the one i feel now at and and
there never was grief or tragedy like that which i feel now
in in that sense only is the material new
actually its its very old but its the very fact that it can be that old is an indication of mans immortality i think that he does endure
he has has lasted so long that there s nothing new in his aspiration and hope save to himself that there s nothing new in his tragedy save to himself that he still can want to be better than he is
he can still believe that injustices hall not endure it must be changed it must be corrected
his progress is very slow almost infinitesimal but there is progress
little children for instance dont have to work in sweatshops
your grocer cant sell you poisoned food
some progress
people are concerned enough to try to do away with war to do away with poverty
that s some advancement
man should ve advanced much faster i grant you
that s some advancement and and if it were not for that capacity to advance that desire to advance very likely he would ve been effaced from the earth long before this along with the dinosaur and the other big lizards
sometimes the characters in my books surprise m eyes
they dont surprise mein doing something that in ever heard of or never imagined human beings doing before but i had nt expected them to do it at that moment that s that s because as i said my chore as a writer is to run along behind these people and put down what they say and do but if they do things which tome seem completely outside the realm of human behavior then i know that s wrong and that s false and and must be thrown away
sir do you constantly add to these characters well i dont add
the the stories im working on do suddenly it turns up with with some blok e ive never heard of before
it doesnt mean sir could you make the distinction between the description of a character having run behind them and a news clip in the daily newspaper
well there s it seems tome this difference the piece in the daily newspaper is a correlation a gathering of facts after the fact
that is no reporter can follow along behind the people who are approaching acris or a climax or a crime say
the writer can do that
he can start when they getup that morning and follow the characters up to the moment when they pull the trigger or rob the bank or or jumpin the water and save the baby but the reporter has got togo around and and ask people what happened what did you see
there s that difference
its you might say the same thing but but one is approached from behind it the other from in front of it
is that enough to warrant an approach to the subject ime and owe find in this position of the observer is that sufficient to give a title to a newspaper or to a novel
well its sufficient
only the man that is writing the same circumstances for the novel is compelled to do a little more research that is the reporter can can ask inquire seek out and get the simple facts and since its its printed in the in the newspaper the reader will accept that
in the book the writer is not too sure that his readers will accept that so he s got to take the fact if that s where he starts then he s got togo backward to follow these people up to the point to explain why they they perform that action they are quite a like the two crafts but they must be approached as i said one from from behind the fact one from in front of the fact
we might say that if its in the newspaper you believe it if its in the book you ve got to prove it since one is on its face fiction and the other is supposed to be fact sir in your writings do you have a particular character or situation or do you find that you like to have a specific character do a certain thing so that certain characteristics ring true or do you have that situation come up a lot
i mean in that you liked the sound of the bell you like to hear it you like to put it down on paper regardless of the characters
noi dont
nono its that character that rings that bell not me by that time the character has taken charge of of his own tale and no matter what i want him to do he may do it and he may not do it but he s going to decide what he does next
he s going to decide if he want storing that bell
i just report the fact that he rang that bell
i believe you had a question i would like to knowhow you started writing
how didi start writing yes well id always liked to scribble probably just like the would be lawyer likes to argue maybe and the would be doctor or biologist likes to cutup flies but i think i became a professional writer i was living in new orleans and i met sherwood anderson and i liked him at once
we would meet in the afternoon and walk around new orleans and he would talk and i would listen
we would meet again in the evening and we would goto a pleasant courtyard and s it over a bottle of whiskey and he would talk and i would listen until and ando clock
the next morning he dbe in seclusion working
wed meet again in the afternoon again in the evening and the next morning he s in seclusion working and i thought to myself if that s all it took to be a writer then
and so i started a book and right away i found that writing was fun
and i had nt seen mr anderson in in weeks
i met m sanderson on the street one day
she said what the matter
are you mad at us
i said noma am
im writing a book
she said good god
is a wher again and she asked me how the book was getting on
it old her just fine
she said do you want sherwood to read it
i had nt thought of anybody reading it
i said well m if he wants to its all right with me
she said well he say shell make a trade with you
if he dont have to read that book hell tell his publisher to take it
so i said done and i finished the book and he told his publisher mr live right to take it and that show i got printed
but up to that time id never thought of being a professional writer because it was still fun
that s the first time id ever really connected money with with writing a book
but the i think the pleasure in scribbling must have been there all the time
i imagine that as soon as i learned to spell i must have been trying to write something
i dont remember what it could ve been but that s that s a curse that were probably born with
yes sir when you are writing a book are you ever conscious of trying to put up a philosophy of your own through a reading of your characters
no siri m not
i think that s that s one thing that should be on the frontpage of every book the author is not responsible for the opinion of these people inside
that s that s their notion
of course when they agree with mei m happy to put down what they say
when they dont agree with mei still put it down but their opinions are their s
i think that if the writer is going to write simply to express his own opinions then he is not primarily a fiction writer he s a propagandist or a polemic is t that the writer is engaged primarily in writing about people engaged in the amazing eternally interesting follies and tragedies and heroism which people are engaged
that the symbolism the style the philosophy the ideas are only coincidental and probably to the writer not too important mr
faulkner
in some of the statements published about you in the news stories that you have made the distinction between yourself and the demon who makes you write who or what is that demon
well siri dont know myself
probably he harasses me too much forme to have a good chance to turn and look at him
it could be as is aya desire to leave some mark on on the world so that people after you will know that for a little while that smith was here he made this scratch
it well i dont think its its its for glory
its certainly not for profit because there are many more more profitable things than being a writer
it its its certainly not to change mans condition
if anything i would say that s what it is its simply to leave a scratch on on the earth that showed that you were here for a little while
when or how do you decide on the titles
titles i think the well in my case the good titles are like gentle lightning strokes
i dont know where they come from
suddenly there is just exactly the right title
the only time i ever hunt forever had to hunt for a title it was a bad one
it never did please me
the other sidon t know where they came from
suddenly the situation the character the book or something about it brings the title out of out of the mysterious unknown or out of the background or experience
i dont know where it comes from not always at the beginning
sometimes the title is the first thing the title invents the story sometimes the title appears in the middle of the story
ive never had one that finished without a title that i had to hunt around and invent one in the title of requiem for an undoes the nun have to refer to either temple drake stevens or to nancy
the nun was nancy
well it was in the that tragic life of a prostitute which she had had to follow simply because she was compelled by her environment her circumstance to be it
not for profit nor any pleasure
she was just doomed and damned by circumstances to that life
and despite that she was capable of within her her poor dim lights and reasons of an act which whether it was right or wrong was a was a complete almost religious abnegation of the world for for the sake of of an of an innocent child
that was it was paradoxical the use of the word nun for her but i but tome that added something to her tragedy
did your title the sound and the fury come from shakespeare s macbeth
yes yes there must have been a dozen books titled from that speech
i think that i had the best one but i can think of six or seven books all from that same speech mr
faulkner do you feel any compulsion to be understood
does it make any difference to you that a great many of us are confused by what you are driving at
well its not a compulsion
its a regret that im not but there s the demon its the writer has got to write so fast because he knows that anyway hell never livelong enough to write all he wants to and he wishes that he could be more coherent and could write simpler and plainer but there s that need to get the whole history of mans heart on to the head of that pin during his threescore and ten years and he has nt got time togo back and rewrite it which he he wishes he did have time if he could call time out and rewrite the book and make it clear and simple but he dont have time because that one was wrong and he s got to write another one to still try to put the history of mans hope and aspiration and passion and tragedy and folly and comedy on the head of a pin before he has togo through the last ultimate bottomless wall
do you feel that your characters are universal
i know that you area regional writer and i just wondered or do you care
i feel that the verities which these people suffer are universal verities
that is that man whether he s black or white or red or yellow still suffers the same anguishes he has the same aspirations his follies are the same follies his triumphs are the same triumphs
that is his struggle is against his own heart against with the hearts of his fellows and with his background
and in that sense there s no such thing as a regional writer
the writer simply uses the terms he is familiar with best because that saves him having to do research
that he write might write the book about chinese but if he does that he s got to do some research or somebody ll say ah
you re wrong there
that a in t the way chinese behave
but if he uses his own region which he s familiar with it saves him that trouble to what degree the characters
none
there was never a writer that wasnt convinced that he could create much better people than god can that s why no writer can ever write his own biography
he cant tell the truth that long because a fiction writer is a congenital liar to begin with you see that s what makes him a fiction writer
that s what the word fiction means and so he not only couldnt tell the truth he she s convinced that he could create much better truth than circumstance can
do you ever have a character that you are so enthused with and had to in a word cut him out
yes in the sense that yes that you get to of on d of a character too amused at him or too interested and and he he will say and do things which for which there s there s no place in the story you retelling that you have to throwaway yes
that s just a matter of using the having enough ruthlessness to use the blue pencil
that what he he does is still true enough still human enough but there s simply no place for that in the pattern of the story which you retrying to tell so you ve got to cut it out yes that happened once or twice
yes ma am
why are you so fond of the comp sons and the s no ps es
well i feel sorry for the comp sons
that was blood which was good and brave once but has has thinned and faded all the way out
of the s nope sim terrified
that was tour de force of course
i took these people of of the kind which i know and simply subjected them to the two fiercest natural cataclysms which are flood and fire
that was a certain amount of deliberate symbolism but tome the very fact that these people endured for a reason that on the face of it was foolish that is to carry their mother that far just to bury her but it was noble in that they had promised her to do that and so they were they had dropped their own baseness their own pettiness to follow out this simple wish of the mother which was noble eventhough it was foolish and that tome is another indication that man is immortal that he will endure because even in his folly he s capable of doing something not for his profit at all but simply because his conscience or something call it god if you like says do this and so even in his folly without believing that he is that brave and that compassionate he does brave and noble things mr
faulkner have you been influenced by the divine comedy in anyway
i have like every writer been influenced by every word i ever read from the telephone book up and down i think that that s true of anyone that writes that he is completely amoral
he steals right and left without even knowing he s doing that
he stows that away and then if he ever needs i the reaches in his mind and he digs it up and uses it
yes siri ve been influenced by that by everything ive read not deliberately
you just can the lp it
that s apart of the of the experience which makes man the manor the child want to be a writer you said you only liked to scribble did you like to parse sentences no siri didnt
i had to learn something about that in order to follow my craft but in ever did like togo to school and is topped going to school as soon as i got big enough to play hooky and not be caught at it
that was about the sixth grade but i had to learn the to use the tools of my craft just as as the wood choppers got to learn to use an a x in order not to chop his own feet off
these characters that you follow along do they come to a natural conclusion or do you have to cut them of for do they tell the story and that s the end of it or what
nono they exist
they are they are still in motion in my mind
i can laugh at things they redoing that i have nt got around to writing yet
not hats where the rules of the craft come in that someone some editor has got to give the whole thing unity coherence and emphasis to start at a decent starting place and then stop it somewhere at a logical reasonable place
but the characters themselves they walk on out of that book still in motion still talking and still acting
because of your interrupted education it makes me wonder if formal education i think that nobody can know too much can learn too much
i think that one can be a writer without the formal education
i think the formal education will not do the writer anymore harm than anybody else but im convinced that nobody can be taught anything that you must learn it
and the value of formal education is that all the knowledge the wisdom the opinions on the wisdom on the knowledge which makes wisdom is there convenient for you to get
otherwise you ve got to run from pillar to post to find what is right there offered to you
but nobody can teach anybody anything im convinced of that
you ve got to want to know it
you ve got to want to learn it
i meant that love and money and death are the the skeletons on which the story is laid
they have nothing to do with the with the aspirations and the conflicts of the human heart involved
but but the story has has got to have some skeleton and the skeletons are are love or money or death
in s ut pens case there was he he needed the money in order to satisfy his aspiration
and it was his foreknowledge of death which compelled impelled in him the haste to be completely ruthless to do it while he still could
the love was apart of of his conflict too
he wanted wanted that son for for vanity of course
but you ve vanity is not really enough
you ve got got to love the thing that you can be vain because of or proud because of
it had to be his son not just he could ve adopted a child you see and and carved out a plantation the and from from greece from olympus in it somewhere
it lasts just for a day or two then its gone but every year in august that occurs in our country and that s all that title meant it was just tome a pleasant evocative title because it it reminded me of of that time of a luminosity older than our christian civilization
maybe the connection was with lena grove who had something of that pagan quality of of being able to assume everything the desire for for that child
she was never ashamed of that child whether it had any father or not
she was simply going to follow the conventional laws of the time in which she was and find its father
but as far as she was concerned she didnt especially need the father for it anymore than the than the women that on whom jupiter begot children were anxious for a home and a father
it was enough to have had the child
and that was all that meant just that luminous lambent quality of an older light than ours is rose for emily all fiction yes sir that s that s all fiction for the reason i said too
if anytime a writer writes anything that seems at all familiar to anybody anywhere he gets a letter about it and if they think he got enough money he s sued too so he s awful careful not to write anything he ever saw himself or anybody ever told him
were all very grateful to you for coming this afternoon
i want to thankyou so much
thankyou
this interminable valedictory does seem to becoming to an end at last
i have tried to express to mr gwynn and mr
blot ner how much pleasure i have had here
i would like to say to the people of charlottesville too how much pleasure this has been forme
its been so much pleasure that iam a little concerned about whether it could have done any good or not that anything this much fun must be bad some way
there is a ridge you drive on beyond seminary hill and in time you come upon it a mild unhurried farm road presently mounting to cross the ridge and on to join the main highway leading from jefferson to the world
and now looking back and down you see ally ok napa taw pha in the dying last of day beneath you
there are stars now just pricking out as you watch them among the others already coldly and softly burning the end of day is one vast green soundless murmur up the northwest toward the zenith yet it is as though light were not being subtracted from earth drained from earth backward and upward into that cooling green but rather had gathered pooling for a nun moving moment yet among the low places of the ground so that ground earth itself is luminous and only the dense clumps of trees are dark standing dark and immobile out of it
then as though at signal the fireflies lightning bugs of the mississippi childs vernacular myriad and frenetic random and frantic pulsing not questing not qui ring but choir in gas if they were tiny incessant appease less voices cries words
and you stand suzerain and solitary above the whole sum of your life beneath that incessant ephemeral spangling
first is jefferson the center radiating weakly its puny glow into space beyond it enclosing it spreads the county tied by the diverging roads to that center as is the rim to the hubby its spokes yourself detached as god himself for this moment above the cradle of your nativity and of the men and women who made you the record and chronicle of your native land proffered for your perusal in ring by concentric ring like the ripples on living water above the dreamless slumber of your past you to preside un anguished and immune above this miniature of mans passions and hopes and disasters ambition and fear and lust and courage and abnegation and pity and honor and s in and pride all bound precarious and ramshackle held together by the web their on thin warp and woof of his rapacity but withal yet dedicated to his dreams
they are all here supine beneath you stratified and super posed os seo us and durable with the frail dust and the phantoms the rich alluvial river bottom land of old is set ib be ha the wild chickasaw king with his negro slaves and his sisters son called doom who murdered his way to the throne and legend said record itself said since there were old men in the county in my childhood who had actually seen it stole an entire steamboat and had it dragged intact eleven miles overland to convert into a palace proper to ag grand is e his state the same fat black rich plantation earth still synonymous of the proud fading white plantation names whether wei mean of course they ever actually owned a plantation or not s ut pen and sartori s and comp son and edmonds and m cc asl in and beauchamp and grenier and haber sham and holston and stevens and de spain generals and governors and judges soldiers even if only cuban lieutenants and statesmen failed or not and simple politicians and overreach ers and just simple failures who snatched and grabbed and passed and vanished name face and all
then the road less almost path less perpendicular hill country of mccallum and gowrie and frazier and muir translated intact with their pot stills and still peaking only speaking only the old gaelic and not much of that from culloden to carolina then from carolina toyo kpa taw pha still intact and still speaking not much of anything except that they now called the pots kettles though the drink even i can remember this was still us que ba ugh then and last on to where frenchman s bend lay beyond the south southeastern horizon cradle of var ner s and an the ap of the northeast crawl of s nope s
and you stand there you the oldman already white headed because it doesnt matter if they call your gray hairs premature because life itself is always premature which is why it aches and anguishes and pushing forty only a few years from forty while there rises up to you proffered up to you the spring darkness the un sleeping darkness which although it is of the dark itself declines the dark since dark is of the little death called sleeping
because look how eventhough the last of west is no longer green and all of firmament is now one un lidded studded slow wheeling arc and the last of earth pooled visibility has drained away there still remains one faint diffusion since everywhere you look about the dark panorama you can still see them faint as whispers the faint and shapeless lamb en ce of dogwood blooming return loaned light to light as the phantoms of candles would
and you the oldman standing there while there rises to you about you suffocating you the spring dark people d and myriad two and two seeking never at all solitude but simply privacy the privacy decreed and created for them by the spring darkness the spring weather the spring which an which an american poet a fine one a woman and so she knows called girls weather and boys luck
which was not the first day at all not eden morning at all because girls weather and boys luck is the sum of all the days the cup the bowl proffered once to the lips in youth and then no more proffered to quench or sip or drain that lone one time and even that sometimes premature too soon
because the tragedy of life is it must be premature inconclusive and in con clu d able in order to be life it must be before itself in advance of itself to have been at all
mr faulkner
in in this book the town we come across so many of the characters we have met previously are those four snaky s nope ses new
are the what s nope s new the four snaky s nope ses in the last chapter
not tome
i thought of of of these people thirty years ago and and the more i thought about them the more s nope s they invented
its simply that i have nt got around yet to telling about them
there s one more volume which i hope will be the last but i have no assurance that it will be it maybe that when i finish that there will still be another
but they are are not new tome
they have been in been alive and have been in motion
i have hated them and laughed at them and been afraid of them for thirty years now
fascinating
that was d juna barnes
she belonged to one of the first minute precious expatriate groups back in the when was that
twenties
yes the early twenties
d juna barnes it was
i dont know whether she s still alive or not
do you know mr
faulkner
who will inherit jefferson if and when the snoops es or s nope ses are ever exterminated
well i believe that man can cope with all his follies
i think that the fact that s nope ses can flourish is just a symptom of mans folly but that man copes with it that he will will rid himself of of even the s nope ses by some desire for simple decency
maybe its just in order to get along with with his fellow men and women in jefferson but he will cope with s nope ses and and what is good in our country will will still endure
it may take a a different phase from what our our ancestors knew it before but i think that even s nope ses can be coped with and even hydrogen bombs can be coped with
sir you dabbled in poetry a little bit before you began writing
did you ever have any published at all or one book
im a failed poet
i still think of myself as a failed poet
i believe that any writer wants first to be a poetry a poet
when he finds that he cant write first rate poetry and poetry of all must be first rate
there are no degrees of it
its either first rate or its bad
its rotten
then he tries short stories which is the next severe medium
when that fails then he goes to the novel that is he wants first to take take the tragedy and passion of of experience of life and put it into fourteen words
if he can the tries two thousand words
if he fails that then he takes a hundred thousand
where do plays work with that category
the play partakes of a little of all
that is a a special specialized medium almost
it it must to be good it must partake of of all three of the poetry of the short story and the novel but certainly its its above the novel because it dont take quite as many words that a good playwright dont have to talk as long as a novelist has to talk to tell his story
noi doubt if anyone has a favorite poem unless its somebody that has a favorite poem by edgar a
guest that s good for visitors and ii dont think anyone could have a favorite poem
it depends on on how you feel what you like to read and remember of something that you have seen or run into that makes you think of truth as some poet has expressed it mr
faulkner
in a fable was there any definite attempt on your part to more or less put it in biblical language
that was the only book i ever wrote from an idea and so i cant say myself just how much of the intent was deliberate to follow the story of the passion week or a pattern of of any christian legend or even the language of the bible though i mim quite sure that the that the deliberate intent was there but how much i cant say because i think the writer when he is busy telling his story he has nt really got time to think about style or or about the pattern of of his sentences
he s too busy but anyone writing writes from his own experience his own observations his own imagination and all he has read is apart of his experience and so in the heat and fury of of composing his piece he will reach back into his memory and he will dig up all sorts of things and will fit them into the joint just as the carpenter does with aboard until he finds the one that makes the best joint or makes the soundest corner or the driest roof and so i think that no man can say just how much of of a style a method is deliberately deliberate or unconsciously deliberate or what
in fact he s so busy trying to tell his story that he dont really care do you do much rewriting mr faulkner
no more than i can help
im lazy an did heap rather think of a story and and laugh over it myself than togo to the trouble to put it down on the paper
i put that off as long as possible
then when it worries meso much i cant put it off anymore then i put it down and i try to be sure that its rights oi wont to have to rewrite it though sometimes its its wrong and ido have to well how are your are your characters created out of your own imagination or are they taken from people you ve known
any writer is completely amoral
any artist is
he takes what he think she will need from any source with no compunction and with no sense of being amoral or unmoral because anyone after him is perfectly at liberty to take anything from him they want
also i doubt if any writer would be satisfied with with men and women just the way the lord makes them
he s convinced he can make a much better job than that and any fiction writer is a congenital liar to begin with and he probably couldnt tell the truth about anything that no matter what he tried to tell the truth about he would embroider just a little mr
faulkner
after you have written your book and maybe read it over two or three years later do you find symbolism in it that you didnt realize at the time you were writing it
do you find you ever find more in it than you realized at the time you were writing it
i doubt if a writer ever reads his book again i think that that s one saving thing he has in his craft that everytime he writes a book he knows that s one book he wont have to read also the reason that the writer writes another book is that one that he finished wasnt quite good enough to suit him and he dont want to read that book anymore
he wants to forget that book because he s trying to write the next one which maybe good enough of course he knows that one probably wont be good enough too but that s what keeps him going
that s why taken by and large his life is so happy
he has something to wake up tomorrow morning to need to do not to want to do but to need to do that drives him to do it
but its never quite good enough for him so he doesnt need to read it again
he s not interested in what anybody else thinks about it because he himself knows it a in t good enough for him and that s the only opinion he really cares about mr
faulkner
you often have referred to male authors that you have enjoyed
are there are any women writers you esteem
yes any number
bront or will a cat her ellen glasgow any number
i think that when i refer to authors as male sim simply using he as assort of a a simplified term to express an individual
yes any number of of good ones was wuthering heights one of your favorite books
i remember you gave usa list and i dont remember them all
i dont really have favorite books
i have books that i read many times over and over but its not for the book its for the people in it
there re certain people that i like to read about just as you like togo into a room and spend thirty minutes with an old friend and wuthering heights is a book that i have admired for its craftsmanship but but there s there s nothing in it that i would ever ever read again probably though someday i might mr
faulkner
when an idea germinates for a story do you start with the story or the situation or with the characters a certain character that interests you
sometimes its a situation an anecdote or or a picture
usually its a character usually its a character
and the character takes charge of the of the whole thing and begins to invent his supporting cast and and then they all go charging away at full speed and tell the story and all ido is just to run along behind them and put it down but they take charge of it
its its usually a character though occasionally an anecdote of something a picture a mental image that has has to do with with something of the human condition
i wrote one book from from the mental picture of a little girl climbing a tree to look in a forbidden parlor window
shed fallen down in the mud on a rainy afternoon and the image was the muddy seat of of that child about twelve or thirteen years old the muddy seat of her drawers and that was i think the what the book came from
did you start writing now you probably answered this question a million times but did you start writing at a definite period of your life or have you always written more or less since the time you were a little boy
i imagine that i had had been scribbling as soon as i learned to spell ive told this story before
if anyone has heard it i hope they will excuse it this time
that was as soon as i learned to spell an did always liked to imagine stories and occasionally put something down but i was still had not taken it seriously until i was in new orleans
i was working for a bootlegger this was back in the in the twenties and i met sherwood anderson and we liked each other right away
we would meet in the afternoon
we would walk around the french quarter along the docks and he would talk and i would listen
wed meet again in the evening
wed goto a nice patio or courtyard and weds it over a bottle of whiskey and he would talk and i would listen
in the morning i wouldnt see him
he dbe in seclusion working
and that would goon day after day the afternoons to walk and laugh and talk and the evenings to drink and laugh and talk in the mornings in seclusion working
and i thought that if that was all it took to be a writer that was exactly the life forme
so i started a book and right away i found that it was fun that i liked it and i got so interested in it i forgot about mr anderson
i had nt seen him for several weeks and i met mrs anderson on the street
she said what s wrong
are you mad at us
we have nt seen you in along time
i said noma am
im writing book
she said good god
ime thera week or two after and she asked about the book
is aidi was just about to finish it
she said do you want sherwood to read it
i had nt thought of anybody reading it
i said well m he can if wants to
she said well sherwood say shell make a swap with you if he dont have to read that book hell tell his publisher to take it
so i said done and he told his publisher to take the book and that show i became took up writing seriously
up to that time id done it well it never occurred tome that anybody might want to read it or had nt thought of it in public term still then but if you had nt met sherwood anderson it would have been inevitable though
oh yes
yes indeed
i think the writer is driven by a demon that he can the lp himself anymore
that s a vice really
nothing he can do about it
and he just wastes time fighting it best thing is togo on and be a writer
what would you give as your definition of poetry
its some moving passionate moment of the human condition distilled to its absolute essence
this is a probably a question you ve been asked many times also
why have you or have you ever been tempted to do playwriting
no probably because i have spent all my life in the country and i can count on my thumbs almost the plays ive seen i have never thought in terms of of of theater
it maybe it takes a a special temperament to do it but i have never never thought in terms of theater
im sure the main reason is that ive never seen enough of it that i like to read plays
id much rather read one than see one considering the sherwood anderson connection had he written winesburg ohio when you met him
yes
yeshe was working on on dark laughter then
he that was after winesburg and after the triumph of the egg
his two best i think well his best character seems to have been george willard and isnt it a bit tragic that he left him in winesburg and never revived him
i dont think so
that george willard is alive enough
there s no need to harass and worry the mantodea th he has come alive and as as you say he s the best character
that s enough since your characters for instance sometimes come from your reading and your experiences you must have occurrences of unconscious plagiarism or atleast fears that you have read it somewhere before
how do you cope with such a situation
well as i said any writer is completely amoral that he has very likely stolen it from somewhere but then he has no qualms about that because anyone after him that steals from him flatters him and he assumes that every other writer feels that way
there are so few things to write about and the human condition changes so slowly that very likely almost any situation except for a few minor differences has already been written about by somebody and very likely you read it somewhere
that reading tome is part of ones experience as much of ones experience as as dealing with actual flesh fresh flesh and blood people but there sim sure that any writer is ready to admit that he has stolen from everything he ever read and he has read everything from the telephone book up and down
you have been called among other things a christian humanist
i was wondering if you could tell me what you consider your relationship to the christian religion
why the christian religion has never harmed mean di hope in ever have harmed it i have the sort of of provincial christian background which one takes for granted without thinking too much about it probably
that improbably within my own lights i feel that im a good christian
whether it would please anybody else s standard or not i dont know do you know where your story is going when you start working mr faulkner
the end when you start
only only twice have i known where the story was going
once was in in fable
the other was in a book called as i lay dying
they were both tour de forces oi knew where they were going
the other sidon t know where they re going
i simply try to keep up with the people who have already gotten in motion to put down what they do and say and then have a little time afterward to throwaway the trash but it hats probably true with with most writers unless they do write from a from a synopsis that they dont know where the story s going
some writers can work that way and the in decision is eliminated
that is that first draft that first synopsis may have taken taken care of the of the confusion which my method follows about where the thing is going do you have a synopsis or do you nom in ever have a synopsis and in ever have made research and dont keep notes because if i was going togo to the trouble to keep note sid try to write it so i could print it
its too much trouble
i dont like to write that much
did you study or have a formal writing classes college
i didnt goto college
i didnt like school and quit in the sixth grade
im the oldest living sixth grader i think i learned to write in the only possible way that there is to learn to write which is to read and to read and to read and to try it and to try it and to try it until it until it suits you which of course it wont do
but to try and to try and to try but reading is the way to learn to write
i doubt if anyone can be taught anything anyhow but i dont believe anyone can be taught to write you ve got to be demon driven and to want to learn in spite of everything mr
faulkner
you say you follow your characters with a notebook and recall what they do and say
you do not plan any of the conversations
no mid on tor any of the incidents
no you re not responsible for anything they do
noma am
im not responsible for anything they door say
any ideas they express are their s and not mine if i have the same idea its purely coincidental
do you find that you can write almost anywhere on a trainor riding in the backseat of a car or in an office
oh yes
sure just anywhere
i put it off as long as i can
then when i cant put off any longer i can write anywhere on anything and with anything except a typewriter
im not much good with a typewriter mr
faulkner
have you picked up anything interesting whether ideas or people during your stay in charlottesville
that comes back to the to the writers complete amorality that he dont have to say now lets see if there s anything in this alley that i can use
he just picks it up whether he can use it or not and later on he finds that maybe he can but he don the s calls for a phenomenal memory then
well its its a phenomenal memory in the sense that the muscle remembers that its not anything that s really catalogued into the mind its catalogued into whatever muscles of the human spirit produce the book or the music or the picture and well assume that there are muscles in the spirit that do that
the the artist is well its a little more than kleptomania its a little of kleptomania but rather more of of whatever it is that makes the magpie pickup everything or the pack rat pickup anything that s loose
i think that s the way the writer goes through life through books and through the actual living world too
that he misses very little not because he s made up his mind before breakfast not to miss anything today but because those muscles do it for him and when the need comes he digs out things that he didnt know where he saw them which to him dont matter
he may have stolen i the probably did but to him that s not important
the important thing is if he uses it worthily
if he makes some base use of it then of course its a shame
but he wants to when he steals he wants he wants the owner that he stole from to approve of what he did with it or not to disapprove too much
happen among people and if anything can happen to improve mans condition and get rid of his bother and trouble it will be for amateur to meet amateur not for professional to meet professional but for amateur to meet amateur and if ido have the amateur quality that people in charlottesville have have felt and been in sympathy with then then my time here has been more than just happy its been worthwhile too
i imagine that there could be circles conditions in which the writer in residence would have to be a literary man but but im not a literary man and and im happy to know that in charlottesville atleast ive been forgiven for that
how much of yourself do you include in your characters
well i consider that im in the public domain just like you and mr gwynn and anybody else that i meet but im still convinced that i can make a much better job of faulkner than god made of faulkner so i will if i were writing my own biography very likely i couldnt possibly tell the truth about it actually the writer has got to write from experience observation imagination and and imagination and observation are bound to be colored just a little by experience so actually any artist is simply recounting time after time his own biography or his own history or his own reaction to the human condition which is which is universal to all men but his is a what he thinks is a particular ache and anguish which to him anyway is important enough to put into the music or the picture or into the poem but he must write from what he knows and all he knows is just a little of himself because he will die not knowing too much about himself but he would certainly know very little about anything else
your demon sounds relentless
is there any hope for anyone learning to write if they have apart time demon
well i think that theresa limitless supply of demons just like germs that hang around maybe just looking for lod g ment in anyone that shows any aptitude for ink
that its that s as i said its a vice and its a virulent sort of vice too
if you a in t careful it ll get you mr
faulkner
you ve often talked about the effort to convey condition of man do you think that this can be achieved in comedy
oh yes certainly because so much of mans condition is comedy
its difficult to say just where comedy stops and tragedy begins
his condition is his eternal struggle with himself with his fellows and with his environment and that takes the form of of of comic or tragic situations and the comic situations show the tragedy of his constant indomitable striving with his own heart the heart of mankind or the condition in which mankind has to function so one is just as valid as the other just as important and who can say just where one stops and the other starts
isnt it rather unusual for a man to write his first book setting in full blown and starting that way rather than an outline maybe a first chapter a whole book for the first time
is that what s usually done
well its probably a little unusual for a reasonably prospering young bootlegger to meet a writer like sherwood anderson
that dont happen to everybody you know
how old were you then
twenty two twenty three
that was in the early s after the old war did he advise you on your writing
did he criticize you
nom he wouldnt even read it
that was the trade he made he would never read it
did he talk about writing to you at all about your work
nom we talked about people
rather he talked and i listened
he was telling me the fantastic stories which later he would probably write but i couldnt believe any of it because i knew he was a writer
he talked and i listened but it was not about books because neither one of us were literary people because we were not really interested in literature and books
we were interested in people and the comic and tragic ep hemera of mans condition interested in laughing maybe
do you feel that a writer might be hampered by a college education
keep him from creating the characters no siri do not
i think that a college education is not going to hamper anyone
i think that a lot of people are subject to it that dont deserve it and can do nothing with it but its not going to hamper anyone
i think that the college education will save the writer a great deal of of of trouble which he would have togo to in simply learning about man about the history the record the history of man that is available to him in the university which otherwise he has got to get out and dig for himself and im sorry that i didnt have a college education myself
i think that if you have the demon you re going to write anyway
nothing is going to stop you and it maybe you dont want things too easy
but in ever heard of anyone that was hurt by a college education and any writer that says i would have been a good writer except i put no stock in that because i believe that the mute inglorious milton is a complete myth
in spite of what happens to general comp son and colonels ut pen and colonel sartori s there seems to be a heroic quality about them
do you think that it is still possible for that kind of heroism in the time of which the story in the town is set
yes i think that although man is not always matched with his finest hour im convinced that the hour the need finds the men it it requires
that the men like like comp son and s ut pen who who had the desire to be heroic they failed through through lack of character or absence of things in their character which should not have been there but atleast they tried
but im convinced that the hour will find the men it needs
though the tragedy is the man who didnt find his hour didnt find his chance to be what he could have been and might have been he s tragic mr
faulkner
what effect if any have the opinions of literary critics had on your writing
none
i dont read critics
i imagine that most writers dont
they re too busy
that is the book the writer just finished a in t good enough
he knows that before he s finished it and so he s forgot about that book
he s going to try one next that will be and so since it it didnt meet with his approval he dont care what anybody else s opinion of it is
and in my own case i like to read but iain t going to read what anybody thinks about somebody else side as
id rather read about people have you ever received any rejections lips mr faulkner
yes m for the first few years when id try to write short stories i got plenty of rejection slip show did it affect you
or did it
well i would i would be frustrated and and enraged in the time when i hoped i could get a little money for it but if i didnt need money at that time it didnt make much difference
i sent it somewhere else or ori was busy still writing another one
id probably that sive heard its had a very depressive affect on many writers
it it could on a young writer yes
i think that the young writer maybe doesnt always know or doesnt always have time to decide exactly why he writes under the pressure of of our our culture the only measure for his writing is whether people buy it whether its in the magazines or not and he accepts that and it gives him a lot of bother and trouble until he get salonga little and realizes that s not at all why one writes that the reason one writes is from the full knowledge of death that we all have he knows that someday he will pass into oblivion
he has seen something so so moving so beautiful so aching in the human condition that he wants to write about it and what he is actually doing is to make a scratch on that wall before he passes through the last wall into nothingness he will leave on that wall k il roy was here
not for glory not for money just to say i was here for a little while
i did this
i made something that wasn there before
that s probably the reason he sticks at it why he s not discouraged by a rejection slip
what became of those stories that were rejected in the first few years you were writing
did you just abandon them
noi kept them
i kept them and after a while the folks that rejected them bought them they bought them
no its the sort of demon that is like the mosquito that wont let you sleep
you want to say oh go away lets lets be quiet a while what s the use in going to all this bother and trouble just to write books and stories
but it wont let you sleep
its not that it says you must tell this story
its just that it wont let you alone
that it keeps on whispering to you if you wake up this is a lot of fun
come on
wake up and try it now
the demon doesnt really care which story you write then no mi think its just against repose more than in favor of anything do you see any faces as you describe characters
do you see a physical person as you write
yes yes i dont always hear a name but i always see a physical face a body mannerisms and quite often they name themselves but not always so where did you get your names
the the characters usually name themselves or the situation names the characters
ive never had to hunt around and say now lets see what shall i call smith this time
that he has said this is who iam and this is what im going to be called
have you usually known people with these names
noi try not to use a name ive ever heard because once you do it two days later you get a letter saying dear siri have just turned this matter over to my lawyer how much money do you have
and so any writer is awful careful not to put down any name he ever heard or or to describe any incident he ever actually saw
i read that you admired mr wolfe thomas wolfe s work very much
just what about it what what do you admire about his work
now that was an unfortunate remark i made
it was a group of students
they asked me what i thought about my contemporaries
i said its too soon to say
were not done writing
this was oh twenty twenty thirty years ago
they said well dont you have any opinion of them at all
i said opinion of who
he named wolfe caldwell hemingway dos passos
and i said well i think we all failed so ill have to rate us on what i consider the splendor of our failure and so this is the way i would rate us and ever since that ive been trying to explain that or live it down but that s all it was
to tell the truth i haven tread much of wolfe
ive read one or two of his stories
ive opened his books and read pages or paragraphs but that was an opinion on the tremendous effort that he had gone into to try to put all of of the history of the human heart on the head of the pin that is to tell it all in each paragraph until he died as though he had a premonition of his own early death
that was what i meant by by the failure
that he failed the best because he had tried the hardest he had had taken the longest gambles taken the longest shots
i rated hemingway last not on the value of of the product at all but simply because of of hemingway having taught himself a pattern a method which he could use and he stuck to that without splashing around to try to experiment
it had nothing to do with the value of the work at all
it was simply on the degree of the of the attempt to reach the unattainable dream to accomplish more than any flesh and blood man could accomplish could touch
i understand that in writing the sound and the fury you meant for the first part ben jy s story to be the book and then you went the non afterwards to add three more parts
what prompted you to do that
did you feel the need togo on and explain
it was to be a short story
it was those three children who had been forbidden to come into the house that afternoon for what reason they didnt know
they only knew dimly that grand mama had been sick and they didnt know that they d been forbidden to come in the house because of the funeral and they were curious enough to climb up to see why they couldnt go into the parlor that they had been forbidden to enter
i thought it would be a short story often pages maybe
it got longer and longer and then i began to know more and more about the people in it and i finished the first section and that wasnt rights oi wrote another section
i let somebody else try it
that wasnt right
i let another brother try it
that still wasnt right
i tried it once myself and that still wasnt right
it still is not not good enough to suit me
its still not the book that im convinced if i had nt written it and could start again tomorrow i would write it better
probably wouldnt but im convinced of that sir
id like to ask you about two incidents in the sound and the fury which i didnt i didnt i wasn table to relate to the rest of the story but i thought they were the fact that you threw them in was interesting and one was well i haven tread this for a while and you you say you have nt either one was about something to do with with a broken leg as i recall
and another was a description of an operation which took place in the woods as i remember with a razor blade an did like for you to try to help me understand just how these fit in with the rest of the book and what they had to do with the story as you recall
i dont remember about the operation with the razor blade in the woods though without doubt it it referred to to the castration of the idiot child
after he had tried to molest a little girl they had to do something about him so he was castrated and if the operation in the woods had any application and i cant remember now it was probably something out of the older brothers garbled half mad history and background which he had used as as as a transference
the the brutality of it as a transference on to this shameful thing which which his idiot brother had had to suffer
the the broken bone i dont remember but i mimi worked so hard at that book that i doubt if there s anything in it that didnt belong there
i would have to look at the book again to oh well yes that was to show the the ignorance of these people in trying to repair that broken bone with cement in order to make this completely foolish hegira with that decaying body which they were doing which was in its own way heroic because they had promised that woman that they would take her back to her people to bury her and so they went through fire and flood and all possible natural catastrophes to do this thing which didnt need to be done at all but they had promised to do it so they did sir did when you wrote either the sound and the fury and or as i lay dying did you were you conscious of of making the characters the brothers and sisters and their relationships somewhat similar
i mean would you think back as you as you recall that it seems tome that theresa certain type of family relationship in each of the families which i wouldnt i dont know which one of the books you wrote first well yes probably there is due to the fact that in each one of them there was a sister surrounded by a gang of brothers the one as i lay dying was tour de force
i knew when i put down the first word what the last word of that would be
the other was anything but tour de force
i was completely submerged in the other one i struggled and anguished with it for a year
this is as i lay dying i wrote in about six weeks without changing any of it
if there is any relationship its probably simply because both of them happened to have a sister in a roaring gang of menfolk s
you spoke about the sound and the fury as starting out to write a short story and it kept growing
well now do you think that its easier to write a novel than a short story
yes sir you can be more careless
you can put more trash in it and be excused for it than a short story that s next to the poem
almost every word has got to be almost exactly right
in the novel you can be careless but in the short story you cant
i mean by that the good short stories like chekhov wrote
that s why irate that second its because its it demands a nearer absolute exactitude
you have less room to be slovenly and careless
there s less room in it for trash
in poetry of course there s no room at all for trash
its got to be absolutely impeccable absolutely perfect its more like playwriting then
yes m that s right
that s right
that s right
of course playwriting has one more demand that you re you re not going to keep your audience that long
with a book you can read that a while and put it down and the ngo back and read it but if its a play you cant
if you dont use up your ticket tonight you ve got to buy another ticket
would you care i think you ve made us understand your feeling that a writer is never satisfied with his work but would you care to suggest which one of your works or one or two of your works that you consider that are your own favorites
well that goes back to the old standard of failure
the one that s the dearest tome is the one that caused me the most anguish and trouble just like the idiot child is the dearest to the to the parent and that s the sound and the fury
that s the one i worked at the hardest made the most splendid and tome the most beautiful failure so that s the one that i love
the others didnt cause that much trouble
that is ii found out sooner that i couldnt make them perfect and was willing to quit
with the sound and the fury it took me along time to realize i couldnt make it good enough to suit me before id give it up
do you like to read modern works and if so how do you choose the ones that you like to read
i think most writers as they get old read less and less and i know that i read now the books that i knew and loved when i was a young man
i haven tread a dozen contemporary books in the last dozen years and they were books which someone gave me and said read this i think you will like it or there s something interesting in it then ill read it
but the reason ido is in the old books which igo back to as you goto call on an old friend and talk with him for a while
do you feel that your war experiences in worldwar i had any significant influence on the perspective of the south that you developed inyo k napa taw pha county
i dont know
as i said the writer uses every experience that ever happened to him and he is not interested in just how much one experience changes his own point of view that he is too involved and too engaged with the people that he think she is writing about that he hopes to make come alive and stand up in three dimensions and casta shadow behind them that he himself cant say because he dont really care how much any of his own private experience has changed him that he s going to use it all that he stores everything away willy n illy regardless just as as the magpie picks up everything that glitters or as the professional carpenter dont ever throwaway a plank no matter how crooked or short it is that someday he will use it
can i have one other question in that general area do you see or have you seen in the south an analogy between the civil war and the first worldwar as you knew it
noi dont
i imagine that literary experts or maybe even war literary experts might find analogies
i myself dont recall any
all i remember about the only war i know about was that was the first war when if you were scared you said so
up to that time nobody every admitted he was scared there may have there was a lot of romantic foolishness talked about air fighting in that war which wasnt really there because you were still contending with a machine which would come to pieces or would burn up that there was nothing of the of the quality of matching your your own skill against another human being with the same fine high hopes and desires that you had
you were involved with a confounded machine that would kill you
were very grateful to you for being with us and we thankyou very much
well thankyou all
audience applause good evening ladies and gentlemen
on behalf of the jefferson society omicron delta kappa and the raven society i welcome you tonight to what we consider a rare honor and a privilege
at this time i would like to turn the meeting over to a gentleman who i dont believe could be any could have been anymore aptly chosen a gentleman who is a member of the jefferson society and at one time served as her president who is a member of omicron delta kappa kappa a member in longstanding of the raven society and a holder of the raven award dean of the law school dean ribble
ladies and gentlemen is hall not introduce our distinguished speaker who happily has been a member of our community for a year and half
i would like to just say a word of thanks to the three ancient and honorable organizations which have planned this meeting for us
they re all very old
as we say in law so old that memory the memory of man run ne th not to the contrary
the oldest i believe is the jefferson society
it started in and had as one of its first members edgar allan poe so you see their interest in men of letters is quite old
the other two have equally and greatly added to the life of this university and the three of them are addingto their fame and to our debt of gratitude to them by presenting to us tonight a gentlemen who is a great american a great southerner and one whom were very proud to have as a member of our university mr william faulkner
withdean ribble s permission i would like to elaborate that a little more
with professors to vall s blessings mr
gwynn and mr blot ner have agreed that my tenure as writer in residence here might be a little better if we kept it informal serious but not too concentrated and continuous
that is when im on the fifth floor of cabell hall im writer in residence
when im not there the nim just a mississippi citizen that likes and admires virginia and virginia people
i hope that now you will take me under those conditions that im just a private citizen here that likes and admires virginia virginia people even when they may not like what im going to say that is as far as the university is concerned iam free home here and as far as you re concerned iam free game
only do flush me first
dont shoot me sitting
mr chairman members of the jefferson society the raven society o dk and ladies and gentlemen a hundred years ago abraham lincoln said this nation cannot endure half slave and half free
if he were alive today he would amend it this nation cannot endure containing a minority as large as ten percent held second class in citizenship by the accident of physical appearance
as a lesser man might put it this nor any country or community of people can no more get along in peace with ten percent of its population arbitrarily un assimilated than a town of five thousand people can get along in peace with five hundred unbridled horses loose in the streets orsay a community of five thousand cats with five hundred un assimilated dogs among them or viceversa for peaceful coexistence all must be one thing either all first class citizens or all second class citizens either all people or all horses either all cats or all dogs
perhaps the negro is not yet capable of more than second class citizenship
his tragedy maybe that so far he is competent for equality only in the ratio of his white blood
but even if that is so the problem of the second class citizens still remains
it would not solve the problem even if the negro were himself content to remain only a second class citizen eventhough relieved of his first class responsibilities by his classification
the fact would still remain that we area nation established on the fact that we are only ninety percent unified in power
with only ninety percent of unanimity we would face and hope to survive in it an inimical world unified against us even if only in inimical it y
we cannot be even ninety percent unified against that inimical world which outnumbers us because too much of even that ninety percent of power is spent and consumed by the physical problem of the ten percent of irresponsible s
it is easy enough for the north to blame onus the south the fact this problem is still unsolved
if i were a northerner that s what i would do tell myself that one hundred years ago we both of us north and south had put this to the test and had solved it
that it is not us the north but you the south who have refused to accept that verdict
nor will it help us any to remind the north that by ratio of negro to white in population there s probably more of inequality and injustice there than with us
instead we should accept that gambit
let us say to the north all right it is our problem and we will solve it
for the sake of the argument let us agree that as yet the negro is incapable of equality for the reason that he could not hold and keep it even if were forced on him with bayonets that once the bayonets were removed the first smart and ruthless man black or white who came along would take it away from him because he the negro is not yet capable of or refuses to accept the responsibilities of equality
so we the whiteman must take him in hand and teach him that responsibility
this will not be the first time nor the last time in the long record of mans history that moral principle has been identical with and even inextricable from practical commonsense
let us teach him that in order to be free and equal he must first be worthy of it and then forever afterward work to hold and keep and defend it
he must learn to cease forevermore thinking like a negro and acting like a negro
this will not be easy for him
his burden will be that because of his race and color it will not suffice for him to think and act like just any whiteman
he must think and act like the best among white men
because where the whiteman because of his race and color can practice morality and rectitude just on sunday and let the rest of the week go hang the negro can never letup nor deviate
that is our job here in the south
it is possible that the white race and the negro race can never really like and trust each other this for the reason that the whiteman can never really know the negro because the whiteman has forced the negro to be always a negro rather than another human being in their dealings
and therefore the negro cannot afford does not dare to be open with the whiteman and let the whiteman know what he the negro thinks
but ido know that we in the south having grownup and lived among negroes for generations are capable in individual cases of liking and trusting individual negroes which the north can never do because the northerner only fears him
so we alone can teach the negro the responsibility of personal morality and rectitude either by taking him into our white schools or giving him white teachers in his own schools until we have taught the teachers of his own race to teach and train him in these hard and unpleasant habits
whether or no the ever learns his abc s or what to do with common fractions wont matter
what he must learn are the hard things self restraint honesty dependability purity to act not even as well as just any whiteman but to act as well as the best of white men
if we dont we will spend there s to four lives dodging among the five hundred unbridled horses
we will look forward each year to another clinton or little rock not only further and further to wreck what we have so far created of peaceful relations between the two races but to be international monuments and milestones to our ridicule and shame
and the place for this to begin is virginia the mother of all the rest of us through the south
compared to you my country mississippi alabama arkansas is still frontier still wilderness yet even in our wilderness we look back to that mother stock as though it were not really so distant and so far removed
even in our wilderness the old virginia blood still runs and the old virginia names byrd and lee and carter still endure
there is no family in our wilderness but has that old aunt or grandmother to tell the children as soon as they can hear and understand your blood is virginia blood too
your great great great grandfather was born in rock bridge or fairfax or prince george valley or piedmont or tidewater right down to the nearest milestone so that virginia is a living place to that child long before he ever heard or cares about new york or for that matter america
so let it begin in virginia toward whom the rest of us are already looking as the child looks toward the parent for a sign a signal where togo and how togo
a hundred years ago the hotheads of mississippi and georgia and south carolina would not listen when the mother of us all tried to check our reckless and headlong course
we ignored you then to all our grief
yours more than any since you bore more of the battles
but this time we will hear you
let this be the voice of that wilderness speaking not just to mother virginia but to the best of her children sons found and chosen worthy to be trained to the old pattern in the university established by mr jefferson to be not just a dead monument to but the enduring fountain of his principles of order within the human condition and the relationship of man with man the messenger the mouthpiece of all saying to the mother of us all show us the way and lead us in it
i believe we will follow you
mr faulkner is good enough to answer any questions that you care to raise
you dont have to take issue with the very fine sentiments just expressed sir you spoke of the negro as a child more or less who had to be taught how to live like like the best whiteman but do you think that before that that the well the awful lot of this trouble that s been caused for colored people are by irresponsible white people
dont you think it would be a good idea to educate the white people to accept the negro
yes ido
of course this could go into great length
i was simply stating the proposition in its simplest terms as it seemed tome
i think that all that dont violently repudiate what ive said will agree that the whiteman is responsible for the negros condition the fact that the negro does act like a negro and can live among us and be irresponsible that the whiteman has got to be himself capable to teach the negro to be more responsible than he is yes i agree with you
but then the negro is not going to wait right now while the whiteman educates himself in order to educate the negro
we ve got to do both at the sametime
the negro is not going to wait any longer
sir in your talk you had an analogy comparing the negro with with unbridled horses
if you tried to break these unbridled horses and you turned a lot of tame ones in dont you think its a possibility that you may windup with just a big group of half wild horses
well of course i used the horse as as a quick analogy to state a condition
what i meant by that was the horse that can be trained and maybe has been trained well assume that while that horse was a slave then then he was a docile well behaved horse
but then he was the burden of slavery was lifted from him and he was suddenly freed
that he is still capable of being a docile member of society but the condition in which he was compelled to be a docile member is gone and so we will have to establish a new condition in which he is docile not through pressure but because he himself wants to be
he has got to be taught that its best forme to pull my share in the traces if that s what we ve got to dothan to run wild
dont you feel that if virginia did integrate that the people in mississippi and alabama and arkansas and those places would sort of lose their respect for virginians as southerners and sort of classify them assort of northerners
no siri do not
theresa noisy minority in mississippi and arkansas and and i rather think its in virginia too that will goto any length before they will will risk in anyway improving the negros class condition for economic reasons
that s that s what s so in mississippi anyway
but there are people in mississippi and in alabama and in georgia in the middle of of of where the ku klux klan and citizens councils are active that do believe that whether they like it or not theresa situation now which simply will not goon any longer and our choice is either to do nothing and be run over and and trampled or take ourselves try to take charge of these unbridled horses
and i think that if the people in mississippi and arkansas and alabama could find that there were people in virginia that would take the lead in this they would follow for the reason that there is a respect a feeling of veneration toward virginia that exists as i tried to explain everywhere in the rest of the south
whether its its valid or not i dont know and from some of the things that i have seen virginia do since ive been here i may agree that its not too valid but i think that basically there is that feeling and i believe that there is in virginia the capacity to take the first step in solving solving this problem and if it is taken in virginia the people in mississippi and alabama will follow when they wouldnt follow alabama nor mississippi there s someone over here
on the subject of race relations it seems tome that the continuum in the united states is one of polarity that is the only view tolerated is an is the extreme view
if you agree with that premise of mine would you say that there will be resurgence a resurgence of a moderate view on this subject and what is your conception of that view
i would say that the negro doesnt want to mix with white people anymore than white people want to mix with the negro
the negro simply wants the right himself to decide not to mix
i think that he doesnt want togo to white schools just because they re white schools
i think he wants togo to them because he s under the delusion that white schools are good schools i think from from what ive seen of a lot of schools that no really industrious negro would want togo to one
now that s not true of all schools but but its true of too many white schools
i think that what he wants is mainly the chance himself to decide to be segregated and that if he had that with schools so good that the people in the schools would be too busy passing the work to care what color who s sitting next to them was there wouldnt be any trouble about integration in schools
sir would you consider one of the problems disregarding that you mentioned that the negro was fighting for the chance to be able to segregate himself is it not true that that is what the white southerner is fighting to maintain
in other words if the negro is fighting for the right of association arent the southerners fighting for the equivalent right to disassociate
in other words they dont feel like sacrificing their rights completely in order for the negro to achieve the same rights
in other words they dont feel that they are balanced
do you think that is a valid cause for the southern white to be fighting so strenuously to preserve his equivalent right of d is association
i would say its valid assuming that the southerners fear is valid
i think that his violent attitude toward integration is based in fear
its in mississippi its mainly an economic fear that he has trained the negro to get along with with inferior tools and bad stock and yet to make a living and send his children to school
the whiteman is afraid that if the negro has better tools and better stock the negro will take the whiteman s economy away from him
i think he is afraid that if he gives the negro a chance to choose to be segregated the negro may not choose it that if he was just convinced that the negro would want to keep his own churches and his own schools and not mix with white people then the whiteman would give him that chance but i doubt if some of the white people in the south can ever be brought to take that chance
i believe you inferred in the earlier part of your speech that a good deal of the prejudice is against the negro because of his color and if that be so i wonder if you really think that integration is going to solve this prejudice
i myself think that integration as they mean it now will will never occur that the negro doesnt want it either
i would say though in in five hundred years he will have vanished and i imagine then anyone that wants to join the dar
will have to prove that she s got somewhere as train of negro blood that they ll be descendants of but as i think as the naacp preaches it and as the white citizens councils preach against it it it wont occur because the negro himself as a race doesnt want to mix with white people
he dont like white people that well
but ido think that all the laws in the world are not going to make the two races mix if they dont want to just as all the laws in the world wont keep them apart if they do want to
virginia and i think several other southern states have laws which say that in case schools are mixed with colored and white these schools will be closed
do you think that when these schools are closed the communities will finally come about to deciding that its better to integrate and educate or just do away with education
i think they will come around to integrate for the reason that we have made our schools in this country to a sort of a national system of babysitters and by the time these children have been at home underfoot the parents are going to be willing for them togo to school no matter who else is there
sir what specific program would you advocate to implement this education of the negro race
i would say first to raise the standard of all the schools to the best i would let everyone that can pass the board goto that school
he might have one chance to fail
if he fails he goes to a trade school
if he fails there he goes to the army
audience laughter applause and conversation i mean by that that education should be a privilege
it shouldnt be a duty that im made to do by law whether i want to or not
that is the law can make me goto school but they cant make medo anything there i dont want to
it should be a privilege
people should be willing to walk four or five miles to get to school
do you agree with the administrations proposal for federal aid to the schools
yes if the standards of the schools were improved
i think that more money a in t going to improve the schools that the schools themselves are going to have to begin to improve themselves
they re going to have to get rid of a lot of people that dont have any business in school
they ve got to give teachers better pay and give the teacher some pride in his job and some security that nobody will will fire him
but yes it federal aid will will have togo to the schools because i think the communities cantor or wont
im sorry and at what age do you advocate this entrance examination for students elementary school or highschool
that should i should think the entrance examination would come only to give the failure a second chance that he can goto school as he does now
the first time he fails he goes to a trade school but he will have the right to swot up and take an entrance examination to get back into the grade that he he lost
i think that at college it should be aboard yes
that no matter what credits he brings from his school he should pass aboard examination to get into college yes
yes sir do you think that the federal government will allow the negro to make this choice that you re talking about
the federal government i imagine will do whatever the most folks hollering the loudest at it insist on
it seems like the various groups up north which are pushing integration so hard now will should the south try to adopt this voluntary segregation leave the both the white and black alone then to make that choice or do you think its sort of wrapped up in in power politics from the large northern cities that we are going to continue to be the whipping boy for better or worse
i think that most of the noisy vociferous people in the north dont really know what they re talking about
if they would comedown here and look at it they would know a good deal more than they do now
and i think that they are going to learn because there are more and more negroes moving to the north
in my county there were people moved out since the last sentence census there were something like of them were were negroes
i was through the country last winter bird shooting
i would see houses empty house after house one family on my place gone to chicago
how long they ll stay i dont know
i imagine they ll be back in a year but they ve and i think when more and more of these people begin to crowd in among the white folks in the north a lot of them that talk so loud now will begin to change their tune
sir if the negroes are the wild horses which you imply they are how are they to pass the entrance exams
it seems tome they ll allen dupin the army and well be right back right where we started from
well sir that was an unfortunate simile but i used something that we were all familiar with to express quickly a condition in which ten percent of the population were were not allowed to be members of the population except under sufferance
that s all i meant
i didnt mean that they were horses at all
we could reverse it and say that a community of fifty thousand horses with five hundred loose men moving around in it if you like i simply meant that we have got to to find some some mutual ground to meet on not socially so much as economically and and of course that implies education culture
that is the negro can be equal without having to come in and sleep with you
it seems that the need by the early first colonies the need for an agrarian society to have labor gave birth to this great problem and it also seems that the continual effort and attempt to maintain the society even after has prolonged and added to the problem
do you think and this is my question that the advent of industry in the south the industrialization of the south and the possible eventual destruction of the remaining of the agrarian agrarian society will have any effect upon this problem
and the possible eventual destruction of the remaining of the agrarian agrarian society will have any effect upon this problem
it will in that i think the agrarian culture was the only culture the whiteman went to much trouble to train the negro in
as that vanishes the negro becomes more and more of a problem
when that s completely gone he will be still more and more of a problem and for that reason the whiteman will have to do something to substitute that agrarian economy which took care of the negro
i mean by by took care which assimilated the negro
the negro had a definite place in that economy
now the only contact the negro has with the whiteman s culture is the time payment icebox and and the automobile that hell own someday if he dont tear it up before he finishes paying for it but there s no other contact with the whiteman s culture that the negro has since he was since he left the agrarian economy of slavery
id like to probe really question your statement that no nation can exist with second class citizens
im not aware of any civilization either ancient or modern that has not in some form had a second class citizenry
for example the hellenic civilization probably reached its flower because the leisure of of one class was made possible by the labors of ones who were not only second class citizens but worse
im not defending second class citizenship but it seems that some civilizations exist not only in spite of it but in fact because of the second class citizenship
so i would like to know if there is historical precedent for your statements this i dont know any of those civilizations that have not had a second class citizenship but i dont know of any of them in which that second class citizenship was an arbitrary condition compelled on the second class citizen by the others
he found his own second class level
he was not compelled to it by the color of his skin
if that second class citizen could rise from from his second class citizenship he was he was allowed to
there was nothing to stop him
in our economy its pretty hard for the negro to get very far
that s the only difference
in egypt many thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of workers that were held in slavery and they could not get out of it
those people
true but some of them broke out
you know moses led a big gang of them out himself
audience laughter and talking audience talking i think as you were talking you retaking as the best man being and since activities eventually taking and taking interest in what were doing a while voting you want the best way of educating people who are thinking about the unity not only themselves
dont you think that there should be a great attempt to encourage the negro to vote as much as possible in the south and to think of what he s doing rather than going to practically every means to discourage him as at present
well sir in in principle yes but i think that to give a man a vote when he has no conception of what he s voting for or against is not going to improve him nor his condition much
i still think that the education should come first but then i agree that a lot of white folks that vote have nt got any business voting too but just because they do vote its not going to help things to give a lot of negroes that have nt got any business voting the right to vote
i think that if we ve got to start educating somebody somewhere then lets start with with what is amenable to it and the negro in his present condition he wants to advance himself
he would be more amenable to education than the whiteman would because the whiteman has got spoiled by it
the whiteman says my laws make me goto school and if it ive got to have a good school that suits me
ive got to have a good footballteam or iain t going there
ive got to have cheerleaders ori may not like it
the negro i think anxious to better his condition and i hope that some of his leaders tell him it can be done only by education might be more amenable to education to realize the responsibility that he has when he has the right to vote sir do you think that the integration policies in the north have been successful and if not why
audience talking well probably no integration policies have been successful but then most of the agrarian policies have not been too successful yet somehow agriculture advances somehow the the human condition in which negroes and whites have to live has advanced slowly
it has gone backward since that supreme court decision but since it had advanced gradually and steadily and i think that it will continue to advance gradually gradually and steadily
sir before you made the statement that the northerners were afraid of the negro
what are your reasons for that
that conclusions drawn from from the experience ive had with the northerners
they they they love the negro in theory but they dont want much to do with him
ive noticed that the southerner he he dont love the negro in quantities but he will defend some particular negro
it maybe the nigger just owes him money but anyway whatever the reason is he will defend him
and that s what i meant
i simply generalized from what ive heard northerners say they they they express so many tome bizarre reasons for the negros desire to advance himself
they seem to think that he s wants to take revenge on long oppression from the white race
that maybe true in in certain cases but i think in general the negro dont especially want revenge on the whiteman that his attitude toward the whiteman is something like the whiteman s toward him
he likes a few of them but he dont think much of all of them but his low opinion of all of them is not worth going to a great deal of trouble to get revenge
siri dont mean to suggest that im a northerner but we often say that the northerner ought to comedown and see how things are going on and we often say that they dont understand our problems yet we in the south have an opportunity to do something progressive and i dont think that any of our leaders have ever come up with a good working plan yet
what do you think about that
i agree with you that s what im talking about tonight
i agree with you
but then i dont know of any of of the northerners that have come up with a good practical working plan yet
sir as i understand it you believe that much of the leadership problem that we ve got today is caused by an active noisy minority in each state and if so i five understood you correctly i wonder what your reasons are for believing for thinking or for wondering why the hapless majority refrains or keeps from using their numerical superiority to overcome this leadership problem
well one reason is they dont want to be mixed up in something unpleasant
another reason is that people that compose that noisy majority minority in mississippi anyway if you say something or do something they dont like they may set your house on fire sir if virginia s plea for moderation was ignored once before with particularly disastrous consequences to her as you mentioned before do you think there s much hope for virginia particularly caring to take the lead in the south on this question
it seems tomes he should
it seems tome that virginia should feel something of the same responsibility toward the other states of the south that the virginia younger sons moved into with the surplus slaves two hundred years ago that the father might feel toward his sons
its a i would say maybe the strongest tie would be some tie an an attenuation but still intact of blood of culture of thought of having shared in in the same disasters
i think its theresa definite tie
i think that virginia that what well if you ll allow me the soul of virginia feels the same tie toward mississippi and alabama and georgia as the soul of mississippi and alabama feel and of of of respect toward the mother stock in virginia
i think that that s that san an actual condition
sir in the deep south mississippi and alabama the people seem to be controlled more or less by the ku klux klan
you mentioned the house burnings and stuff like that
and do you think any examples that we set or any reasons we give are going to breakthrough those those members of the ku klux klan who are backed in a lot of cases by the law enforcement agencies who are are pretty ignorant a lot of them
do you think that we can do anything to breakthrough their attitude
i think so
that s the point i make
if if there was a definite quality of of leadership in commonsense apart from emotion and any dragging out of old battle flags that the south the wilderness the frontier part of the south could hear and know about they would have some some reason to feel that if we can throw off these these noisy people too that there are people in other parts of the south that feel as we do
the the liberal in mississippi he s hemmed in more or less by the sort of people that burn crosses and and whip negroes and compose lynching parties and he s afraid to say anything
well he knows that if he says too much something unpleasant may happen to him
then no matter what he says it may not do any good
but if he found out that there were people in other states that felt the same way as he does just as the people that form citizens councils and the kkk they find out that there are people in other states that feel the same way so it builds them up
i think that s what we need
the people that will look on this as something that is going to change whether we like it or not
it maybe that all of us curse the daywhen the first slave was sold into this country but that s too late now
and to live in in this country anywhere in the world today and to to be against giving a man what equality cultural educational economic that he s capable and responsible for is like living in alaska and being against snow you ve got snow
its its foolish to be against it you ve got it
sir this is just a simple question
i wondered if you could tellus if there s any particular class or economic group in the south which the klan draws its members from or whether they come from all walks of life in the south
by and large they come from the poor unsuccessful whiteman
he has has worked hard by his lights and of course he has worked hard he never gets very far ahead and he knows that he never will
he sees the negro with the same sort of land he s got with poorer tools and not as much credit ashes got make a better job of it to raise his family and they seem to be happier than he does
and he he doesnt like that
he s envious
he hates the negro because the negro is beating him a this own poor game which is to make a living on forty acres of poor land
his only superiority over that negro is not economic any longer
its because he s white and that negros not white and so he s going to do everything he can to keep that negro black because it makes him feelgood
that s the only thing the only edge he has
in the light of what you ve just said you also said that the negro wont wait any longer and that he will demand rights and that there s not time to educate the whiteman but dont you really think that its it is a matter of time and along time before the mississippian or the south a lab a mian will actually accept any sort of integration in the south
yes i agree with you
i think it will be atleast fifty years i meant that the negro is now in motion toward more equality and he s got a lot of white folks and government bureaus and courts behind him
i didnt mean that he s going to going to either blow the country up or change it tomorrow
i meant that now he has got pressure outside forces helping him move forward and that is what i think we ve got to got to cope with
either use it direct it or let it run over us
but it will be fifty years before atleast before the integration as the naacp talks about it if that ever does come but he will it will be less time than that before he gets more equality than he s got
i think it ll be less time than that before he can vote in mississippi or before his he he has to pay the same interest on his borrowed money the whiteman does that a whiteman cant cheat him cant charge things on a farm commissary book and refuse to let the negro add up the figures as he can do now in mississippi
sir a lot of southerners argue that complete integration would greatly lower our standards of education but dont you believe that within a few years after complete integration if it worked even moderately well there would bean overall improvement in our standards of education
i dont know
it seems tome to improve standards of education we ve got to get some folks out of the schools not get more in it that dont belong there
sir being a liberal in mississippi as it seems tome you are you have probably had experiences with this vociferous group that seems to know only violence to accomplish its means
it seems tome that you might have had some experience with this group and my question is have you and if you have could you relate what they were
well quite often as individuals they are are not too dangerous
they re just noisy
when enough of them get together they can usually be handled as those north carolina indians got rid of their s that a little firmness will do a lot with them of course that dont keep them from coming around at night and setting fire to the barn
that s just an occupational hazard you ve got to live with
since you say virginia must take the first step how would you propose this especially since the administration has closed the door as far as education is concerned
well that would be something which virginians must decide
what i hope is that virginia will say something has got to be done about this and you people in mississippi and alabama and georgia lets decide what to do either to control it or let it run over us
we did have a vote here though sir and whether it was overlooked the gray plan just a start in the right direction
well the only answer to that is to vote again and vote again and vote again
if you tell people something often enough and long enough whether they believe you or not they may follow you just to get you to hush
sir it seems tome that the main contention here tonight is that the economic and educational status of the negro has propagated in him more s which are detrimental to our society
if this is so why not while segregated raise his economic standards and raise his educational standards
good i agree with you
that s what id like to do
furthermore i would like to give him such good schools that he wouldnt want togo to the white schools
i would like to give him so much equality in his own race and responsibility for it and make him have to spend so much time being responsible for his own equality he wouldnt have time to bother with the whiteman s
yes i agree with you that s what i would do
sir would you advocate letting the negro pay his own taxes too
well don the
we know
well he some of him does
he gets drafted into the army just like he was a whiteman
he risks the same death as a whiteman does
and probably if he had the vote he d vote for the same scalawag and scoundrel the white folk select but he would atleast have the have the right to have voted for him sir assuming that we in virginia take the initiative to lead in this integration movement for the south what guarantee if any do we have that incidents similar to those that just happened in new york in the last couple of weeks wont happen again down here
if we dont have any guarantee what steps would you suggest that we take to stall off any such incidents
particularly the knifing and robberies and so forth
i would say that we train the negro first into the responsibility of having the privilege of going to the white school before we dump him into it that he should be be selected by rigorous examination before he was permitted into the white schools
in the meantime white teachers should be sent to the negro schools to train the negro teacher show to teach the negro students to be equal responsible for the right togo to the white schools
i think if that sim sure what we all want not to happen is a thing like little rock or clinton to have troops with bayonets compel negroes into white virginia or mississippi schools
that s exactly as i see it what were trying to prevent which is if we dont do something we will have
the negro professional men of the south its doctors in particular and the lawyers themselves act as a blockade against the younger the better educated negroes
in important matters in medical societies they wont let them pass the board examinations so what are we going to do about that
you have these old guard negroes who wont let the new better educated the more liberal negroes in as leaders
they will have to be bypassed just like the old guard white people that want to stop progress will have to be bypassed we dont have time anymore to wait around for the old moss backs to die off that might solve it if we had more time but we dont
something s got to be done pretty soon and they would have to be bypassed
and im quite sure theresa lot of that that they prefer the status quo they dont want to change and upset things that probably they they dont want a lot of of smart young negro doctors and lawyers getting in their hair
it makes them behave a good deal like white folks
as a foreigner i have regarded the southerners and the northerners all americans as members of the american nation but here and elsewhere i have observed that there is a difference between the southerner and the northerner
i see a problem here which seems tome greater or more dangerous than the problem of segregation against the negroes
would you please comment
i think i understand what you mean but i dont believe any problem can face this country that we wont drop everything and confederate on unless it maybe the abolishment of automobiles but we are not going to confederate on the problem of segregation
that s the only issue that we we balk at but anything else is ephemeral and the and the american dont take that seriously anymore than he takes most of the of the stuff he talks seriously that a great deal of his talk that sounds serious and meaningful to the foreigner it dont to the american because he it never occurs to him that anybody s going to really believe that but one or two more mr faulkner
whatever whatever you ever like lets give them about two or three more and then
if we have about two more questions and then i think we ve held mr faulkner long enough
i think this last comment is of some interest and i was wondering if you felt that the problem which we face in virginia and in the south has any strong international consequences insofar as the future of the western civilization that is what do our neighbors across the oceans think of us in virginia lets say as this young man has just pointed out when they observe our actions in regard to negroes
i imagine that they have a very pretty a very poor opinion of us but i think that their opinion of us is not near as important right no was what what we virginians and mississippian sandal aba mian s have got to think about ourselves
lets look after our own opinion about our behavior and then lets worry about what somebody else thinks about it as slow and as inefficient as it maybe do you feel that the best problem or the best solution to race integration would be race assimilation
no siri dont think that that would would solve many problems
the same amount of of bickering would goon and they would find another subject for it
i think that the only thing that will solve that problem is not integration but equality for the negro to know that he has just as much and just as valid rights in this country as anybody else has
that his money is just as secure
his children have a right to just as good an education as anybody else does
his vote counts as much as anybody else s that he dont have to pay anymore for the cadillac that he dreams of owning someday than the whiteman has to pay for it i know im speaking for each one of us when i say were all most grateful to mr faulkner for a very interesting and a very stimulating evening that concludes this evening
one of your novels requiem for a nun has been adapted to the theater and was successfully presented in paris and england
do you feel others of your works might be successfully dramatized too and do you plan to do it
i dont know
i dont know too much about theater
i wrote that book as a play
it wasnt adapted
there were sections of it it the story fell into three acts told in dramatic form
it was i think played that way
there were no adaptations and no changes
of course there may have been some changes when albert camus got hold of it in paris
he turned it into an existentialist job but he didnt change it too much
i think the version in in london was about as i wrote it but it was written in that form
i felt at the time that that was the most effective way to tell the story i was trying to tell
i think that s one of the tools of the writers craft that he is at liberty to use whatever method he thinks does the job best
oh yes
of course you ve got to define what you mean by experience
if you restrict experience to what you yourself have done that is a limited field and you would have only a limited field to write from
to tome experience is anything that you have perceived
it can come from from books a book that a story that is true enough and alive enough to move you that in my opinion is your experience is one of your experiences
you need not to do the actions that the people in that book do but if they strike you as being true that they are things that people would do that you can understand the feeling behind them that made them do that then that san experience tome
and so in my definition of experience you its impossible to write anything that is not an experience because everything you have read have heard have sensed have imagined is apart of experience
that is i think there s as much of memory in the nerves and the muscles as there is in the gray matter
i have a question sort of along these lines
its a little long i hope you ll bear with me go slow with it so i wont miss it i certainly will
as background on it mr gwynn asked us to write an outline of a novel that we wanted to write last semester
it was quite a difficult task for meat any rate and here it is the question which comes out of that attempt to write that outline
i sometimes think that the writer who tells the truth has an almost insurmountable problem
first he must know what and how other people think and second he must record what he knows in his artistic creation
if you agree with this premise which part of the writers task is the more difficult knowing a character that is what he believes and how he reacts to the situations and so forth or once you know it getting it down on paper
now there s another case where we ve got to define terms
in my opinion truth dont have very much relation to facts that something s you imagine or you hear you know is true
maybe it a in tso but it should be so
that tome is truth
now give me the second half of your question again well the second half as as i look at the problem of writing the novel is once you have your character in mind then getting him down on paper telling about the character describing his thoughts or his opinions or how he reacts under pressure or his philosophy is getting that down that s the i suppose the mechanical part now what tome is first you know your character and you know what he s like
you know him and then you have to put him down on on the paper as you rewriting and i was wondering if that is the sort of the way you approach a novel which it probably is not but if it is which would you say is the hardest of the two problems to get your character in your mind or to get him down on paper once you have him in your mind
i would say to get the character in your mind
once he is in your mind and he is right and he s true then he does the work himself
all you need to do then is to trot along behind him and put down what he does and what he says its the ingestion and then the gestation
you ve got to know the character
you ve got to believe in him
you ve got to feel that what that he is alive and then of course you will have to do a certain amount of of picking and choosing among the possibilities of his action so that his actions fit the character which you believe in
after that the the business of putting him down on paper is mechanical
its i think most of the writing has got to take place up here before you ever put the pencil to the paper but the characters got to be true by your conception and by your experience and that would include as we ve just said what you ve read what you ve imagined what you ve heard all that going to giving you the gauge to measure this imaginary character by and once he comes alive and true to you and and he s important and moving then its not too much trouble to put him down i think my question follows a little bit from that one
i was wondering to what extent is the creative literary process really sometimes painful and if facility in writing necessarily goes with excellence or the other way around
and if its too difficult does it appear to the reader as being labored and and worked over
sometimes probably
i think of of so much of dreiser that must ve been a terrific anguish to him to write
i can think of well flaubert say that sounds so easy so simple that must have been a terrific effort to him too
probably you cant cant draw any any general generalization from that
now what was the question about the the anguish and trouble
we almost touched on that
tell me that again the first of your question was i just wanted to know to what extent that in the creative literary process is or can be expected to be
well its anything that you like to do better than anything else of course you re willing to make sacrifices for and usually the things that you like to do are troublesome
that is if you like to ski that s that s difficult
everybody cant do it
but if you like it well enough that very anguish is fun
you do it because that gives you more pleasure than anything else you can think of
it maybe difficult just like mountain climbing
nobody would climb mountains just for fun
people dont know why they climb mountains but that s their cup of tea they like
i think that s true of the writer that he she swilling to face the anguish and the trouble of it because one reason is he can the lp i the his choice is either to write or not write and he says well im going to write anyway
the other is to have done the job well then he has has been repaid for the trouble and the suffering well call it that he went through
also he has justified the fact that people must suffer
there s really no good reason why there should be pain you know there s no biological reason for it and yet we constantly suffer pain and fear and if the individual can make something which which makes him feelgood that this is something that wasn there before mean dive made it and its its not quite good enough but its the best i can do and i had a goodtime at it then that is his pay for it this sort of relates to the question before that but when you are writing a novel about a particular group of people and a particular environment just to what extent how fully do you imagine these people and this environment beyond what actually goes into the novel
i think one of the first qualities a writer must have is an inherent in capacity to stick to the truth that he will will take characters situations he has seen with the best intention in the world but despite himself he cannot stick to that
he s going to improve it somehow
he s trying to make something a little new a little different than what was here before and he s not going to worry too much about whether he sticks to the truth and he finds that he s got away from fact i mean not the truth which is as i just said there s not too much relation between fact and truth
when he finds that he has got away from fact he doesnt worry about that
because he has dedicated himself to stick to truth as he sees it
i mean by truth the things which move people
the the desires the passions in the human heart the things that the human heart considers important honor and truth shame baseness courage that s what he s writing about and when he s got to ignore fact to do that better then he wont hesitate to ignore fact because he s not really interested in facts
fact can change too much
fact can be one thing today and something else tomorrow
a posted sign can change a fact you know but it cant change the truth i think some magazines pay more for humorous stories than they do for stories of a more serious nature atleast ive heard a number of writers say that in relation to the new yorker supposedly because humor is harder to write than humorous stories are harder to write than serious ones
do you find that true in your writing that its harder for you to write a funny scene a humorous scene than it is to write one of a serious nature
with me the character does the work and so i couldnt say that its more difficult to write a funny story than as a done that i think the writer is mainly not writing a story
he s writing about people
he thinks of the character
he gets that character from observation from experience from imagination and suddenly that character himself or herself turns out to be funny and then she says and does funny things
i think maybe what you might call a professional writer that has a knack for composition for knowing what magazines will pay the best price for and has the talent to write something to fit that now he maybe able to answer that question better than me but i think ive found it more satisfactory to write mainly about people and let the character himself if he s comic then he does and says comic things and i dont think i would worry too much about that
you ve stated that your method of composition is just to let the story write itself and i was wondering if you could tellus whether or not sherwood anderson wrote in a similar to this fashion
i think so yes
he writing was very difficult for him because he took it up late in life and contrary to his tradition and his training
he had been successful in the ordinary shape of the american dream which was to come from nothing and and by your own shrewdness and skill make something of yourself and establish a certain position in the community
then suddenly he decided he wanted to be a writer and he a this age he he was thinking always well now ami good enough to be a writer
is this a mistake
maybe rather than to try to be a writer and fail i should ve stuck to what i had trained myself to do and he himself didnt have the confidence in what he did
it would be other people that would say well this is this is splendid
this is marvelous
few people can match that
he never did quite believe that
he was afraid that somebody might come along and say this is nonsense its trash
and if someone had he would ve believed that that he himself didnt have the confidence in what he did or in the doing of it which the person that begins to write to want to be a writer young has
when you re young you know nothing
you believe that you can climb a mountain or can fly an aeroplane faster or ride a racehorse than anybody else can
you re not afraid to try anything but in his case he he was afraid
did that answer the question or did it getaway from the question well i dont know
it i thought it was very interesting
i dont know whether exactly was the thing i was well lets have your question again
i got off myself
that s my fault i was just wanted to know if he wrote in the same fashion you did
you said that you just let the story write itself and i was wondering if he did the same thing
yes and generally yes
i think that all people write from in by the same method
its a matter of of imagining any number of things
the writer at the moment of putting it down has got to be a censor to say now this is this is right this is wrong and to throwaway the wrong
anderson didnt quite have that confidence in his own capacity to pick and choose
there was an instinct that would save him in the end
a lot of of the stuff that went into his stories a man with a heart or mind more sure of himself would ve stricken out and would ve gotten rid of some of the sense of fumbling and clumsiness the heavy footed ness which was in anderson s stories which he himself didnt like but in my opinion it had a great deal to do with making his stories
the very fact that they did sound clumsy and and not quite strained but a little puzzled that the truth did come out of of all the heavy footed ness and the fumbling the whatever it was that made him goto the length of reducing some of it to the sort of first reader statements gave something to the final result that no imitator could could match probably
but it was much more of a unhappy strain to him that he never got the pleasure of out of writing that a more facile craftsman could ve done
it had nothing to do with the result of course but it just was
absolutely ido
that is why he stopped being a successful advertiser and became an artist
he had absolute confidence in his vision and and knew it was important enough for something to be done about it for him to try to tell it to show to people what he had seen which he he in my opinion he did marvelously well but clumsily
this is another question about anderson
one critic suggested sherwood anderson felt a particular kinship to gertrude stein
miss stein is spoken of so frequently in connection with the writers of the twenties that i would be interested to know whether you recall any discussion by anderson of her of her work and its supposed influence upon himself
yeshe had the unlettered mans boundless and almost baseless respect for for literacy for education and she was an extremely versatile creature that way
she spoke two or three different languages and she came from a background of people that took the best of education as a matter of course which he didnt have
also she was one of the few people that he could trust
i mean that when she said that what he was doing was good he never doubted it because he knew that she would never do anything to hurt him
other people that told him it was good he never did quite trust
he said well well maybe they ll they ll do something to hurt me tomorrow
im afraid of them
but with her he never was because he knew that she was a well you might say a lady and wasnt was never going to hurt him
do you believe that sherwood anderson was too deliberate in his use of symbols or do you believe that some of his these symbols were unconsciously used in winesburg ohio
a little of both
you ve got to remember that suddenly at the age of about he decided to be a writer
he had to learn a complete new trade with a complete new equipment and up to that time he had probably not thought too much about symbolism
he had to teach himself that as he went along but he what he taught himself he he would stop to prove to be sure that it was right that it was in in accord with the with the symbolism of of the new psychology which was coming along at that time but he had to teach himself his trade as he went along
yes i had had worked in a new york bookstore
the manager was elizabeth pr all amiss pr all then
later i heard that she had married anderson was living in new orleans
i happened to be in new orleans and i had gone to call on her because i wasnt going to bustin on mr anderson without an invitation from him
i didnt think that i would see him at all that he would probably be in his study working but it happened that he was in the room at the time and we talked and we like done another from the start and it was this just the chance that i had gone to call on miss pr all that i had known who had been kind tome when i was a clerk in a bookstore that i came to meet him
well yes i had heard of the double dealer and the people there for years
at that time i went to new orleans to get a job in a ship and goto europe
that was why i happened to be in new orleans at that time
that i had nt it was no pull to be apart of a literary group no
that i had felt the pull i think that any young writers does feel that pull to be with people that have the same problems and and the same interests as him that wont laugh at what he s trying to do that wont laugh at at what he says no matter how foolish it might sound to the philistine but that was the reason i was in new orleans was to get a job with a ship
id like to followup your remark about the philistine for one minute if i can
during the past hundred years or so much has been said and written about the gulf between the writer and the other people of his own time
if this gulf and supposed lack of understanding is a certainty between the writer and his time does exist what would you suggest are some of its causes
probably the writer is just too confounded ly busy with his own private affairs to have much time for his contemporary scene that he saw are of it but he a in t too interested in it that to him the world is not just ad this particular year
to him the world is allman would call anguish in the books and the plays and the poems
that s where he lives
he just happens to have to eat in in but he dont really live there
its been stated that you regard civilization as evil and nature as good and in the bear you seem to indicate that the purity of untouched nature as opposed to the tainted air that hangs about the human spoilers of the wilderness that there is this difference is this the result of a belief that man if he returns to a natural life can be rejuvenated
no and if i ever gave that impression in my work that s not quite true
i think that with any writer civilization his age his time is apart of the equipment the reservoir that he will write from that that is the writer the artist probably dont think anything is either good or bad
it just is and its vastly interesting because it moves and that is the source and the material from which he s going to try to make something
its motion
its people no matter whether what they do is cowardly or brave or or a nuisance or diverting or entertaining
its still motion and he himself has nt got time or inclination either to judge it
i think that anyone who says civilization is bad and and non civilization is therefore good and if man could just leave civilization and live in a tree and eat nuts that he dbe better of fi some men might be better off with that but not everybody would
if if you like to live in a tree and eat nuts then you dbe better off and be happier but the other people that are just as honorable and just as brave that live in the middle of civilization but that s all part of the reservoir that you write from
that s part of the experience to be in the midst of it the motion do you think that sherwood anderson could ve expanded his winesburg ohio into a series of novels as you ve done with you ryo k napa taw pha county people or do you think that he s necessarily more limited to a form like the short story
he was yes limited to that form and his tragedy was that he was limited to that one book that was truth as he saw it
it was valid true truth but he had done it that one time and he never could do it again because the truth it was as though the truth that he was capable of burst on him like a thunderclap all in one flash that there was nothing to progress from nor toward that it all happened to him like a a house falling on him
sir many of the characters in winesburg ohio had the problem of not being able to communicate with their fellow man and i think some of your characters also seem to have that trouble
now you ve said that the most important thing for man is for him to be able to believe in himself
do you believe that before he can believe in himself he must overcome this barrier of communication with others
he would be happier if he could overcome the barrier
i dont believe that the fact that he feel she cant communicate would have anything to do with his own belief in himself
i dont think that whether the writer believe she cant communicate or no the can and he does
i imagine that there s really nobody that doesnt communicate
it maybe hell he he wont want to that hell think that he s sufficient can bean island to himself but he cant whether he wants to or no the belongs to mankind too and in the very fact of belonging to mankind he communicates with mankind
he may not be able to do it articulately
he may not have the quality of of rhetoric but there s there s more to communication than speech you know that s what i meant
i meant just the characters that couldnt seem to get to know people in winesburg ohio
there requite a few characters in that book that a resort of isolated and frustrated because they couldnt seem to get to know other people
i didnt mean writing or speech
oh i see
i think that was out of anderson s own nature that he himself didnt believe that communication was more difficult
i think maybe that he expected more of people than he ever found in people and these characters in his book because of what they thought was a lack of an inability to communicate was they simply couldnt find the the fine virtues in mankind that mr anderson himself believed were there
they re not there
man is capable of anything of everything but of no particular virtue no particular evil
he s it gives meagre at deal of pleasure to have mr faulkner in this class in which we are trying to put down feelings and thoughts on paper and shaping observation and experience into narrative and essay
for i dont know of anyone who really understands so well the longings and frustrations of human beings and has demonstrated so consistently his ability to record this understanding in what constitutes a sort of vision of humanity in a series of stories and novels that are so remarkably skillfully written
i asked mr faulkner if he would read something to us and he chose a story entitled race at morning
he will read some portions of it which will makemake time connect the whole
after he has finished his reading i hope that you will ask questions on that story and any other questions that seem appropriate to the occasion it gives meagre at deal of pleasure to introduce mr faulkner to this class
it was jest dust dark when i seen him about half a quarter up the river swimming jes this head above the water
but i could see that rocking chair he toted on it and i know edit was him going right back to that cane brake in the fork of the bayou where he lived all year until the day before the season opened like the game wardens had give him a calendar when he would clear out and disappear nobody know ed where until the day after the season closed
but here he was coming back a day ahead of time like maybe he had gotten mixed up and was using last years calendar by mistake
which was jest too bad for him because me and mister ernest would besetting on the horse right over him when the sun rose tomorrow mornings owe et supper and fed the dogs and the nih o lp mister ernest in the poker game standing behind his chair until about te no clock when roth edmonds said why dont you goto bed boy
or if you re going to setup willy legate said why dont you take a spelling book to setup over



he knows every cuss word in the dictionary every poker hand in the deck and every whisky label in the distillery but he cant even write his name



can you
he says tome
i dont need to write my name down i said
i can remember in my mind who iam
you re twelve years old walter ewell said
man to man now how many days in your life did you ever spend in school
he a in t got time togo to school willy legate said
what s the use in going to school from september to middle of november when hell have to quit then to come in here and do ernest shearing for him
and what s the use in going back to school in january when in jest eleven months it will be november fifteenth again and hell have to start all over telling ernest which way the dogs went
well stop looking into my hand anyway roth edmonds said what s that
what s that
mister ernest said
he wore his listening button in his ear all the time but he never brought the battery to camp with him because the cord would of bound to get snagged ever time we run through a thicket in fact the only time he ever admitted he couldnt hear was when wed be sitting on the horse waiting forme to tell him which way the dogs went
then it was morning we et and set the stand holder across for uncle ike m cc asl into put them on the stands where he thought they ought to be because he was the oldest man in the camp
he had been hunting deer in these woods for about a hundred years i reckon and if anybody would know where a buck would pass it would be him
maybe with a big old buck like this one that had been running the woods for what would amount to a hundred years in a deers life too him and uncle buck uncle ike would s holy manage to beat the same place at the sametime this morning provided of course he managed to gita way from me and mister ernest on the jump
because me and mister ernest was going to g it him and sho enough as soon as we come to the bayou we seen his foot in the mud where he had come up out of the river last night spread in the soft mud like a cows foot big as a cows big as a mules with eagle and the other dogs laying into the leash rope now until mister ernest told me to jump down and help simon hold them
because me and mister ernest know ed exactly where he would be a little cane brake island in the middle of the bayou where he could lay up until whatever doe or little deer the dogs had happened to jump could go up or down the bayou in either direction and take the dogs on away so he could steal out and creep back down the bayou to the river and swim it and leave the country like he always done the day the season opened
which is jest what we never aimed for him to do this time
so we left roth on his horse to cut him off and turn him over uncle ike sst anders if he tried to slip back down the bayou and me and simon with the leashed dogs walked on up the bayou until mister ernest on the horse said it was fur enough then turned up into the woods about half a quarter above the brake because the wind was going to be south this morning when it ri zand turned down toward the brake and mister ernest give the word to cast them and we slipped the leash and mister ernest give me the stirrup again and i got up old eagle had done already took off because he know ed where that old son of a gun would belaying as good as we did not making no racket at all yet but jest boring on through the buck vines with the other dogs trailing along behind him and even dan seemed to know about that buck too beginning to soup le up and jump a little through the vines so that i taken my holton mister ernest s belt already before the time had come for mister ernest to touch him
because when we got strung outgoing fast behind a deer i wasnt on dans back much of the time no how but mostly jest strung out from my holton mister ernest s belt so that willy legate said that when we was going through the woods fast it looked like mister ernest had a boy size pair of empty over halls blowing out of his hind pocket
so it wasnt even a strike it was a jump
eagle must a walked right up behind him or maybe even stepped on him while he was laying there still thinking it was day after tomorrow
eagle jest th rowed his head back and up and said there he goes and we even heard the buck crashing through the first of the cane
then all the other dogs was hollering behind him and dan give a squat to jump but it was against the curb this time not jest the snaffle and mister ernest let him down into the bayou and swung him around the brake and up the other bank
only he never had to say which way
because i was already pointing pas this shoulder freshening my holton the belt jest as mister ernest touched dan with that big old rusty spur on his nigh heel because when dan felt like i the could go off jest like a stick of dynamite straight through whatever he could bust and over or under what he couldnt the dogs was already out of hearing
eagle must a been looking right up that big son of a guns tail until he finally decided he better g it out of there
and now they must a been getting pretty close to uncle ike sst anders and mister ernest reined dan back and held him squatting and bouncing and trembling like a mule having his tail roach ed until we listened for the shots
but never none come and i hollered to mister ernest we better goon while i could still hear the dogs and he let dan off but still there wasnt no shots and now we know ed the race had done already passed the st anders and we busted out of a thicket and sho enough there was uncle ike and willy standing beside his foot in a soft patch
he got through us all uncle ike said
i dont knowhow hedone it
i just had a glimpse of him
he looked big big as a elephant with a rack on his head you could cradle a yell in calf in
he went right on down the ridge
you better get on too that hog bayou camp might not miss him
so i freshened my holt and mister ernest touched dan again
the ridge run due south it was clear of vines and bushes so we could go fast into the wind too because it had ri z now and now the sun was up too
so we could hear the dogs again anytime no was the wind got up we could even make time now but still holding dan to a canter because it was either going to be quick when he got down to the st anders from that hog bayou camp eight miles below our nora longtime in case he got by them too
and sho enough after a while we heard the dogs we was walking dan now to let him blow a while and we heard them the sound coming faint up the wind not running now but trailing because the big son of a gun had decided a good piece back probably to put a end to all the foolishness and picked his self up and soup led out and put about a mile between his self and the dogs until he run upon the mother st anders from that camp below
i could almost see him stopped behind a bush peeping out and saying what s this what s this
is this who led urn country full of folks this morning
then he looked back over his shoulder at where old eagle and the others was hollering along after him while he decided how much time he had to decide what to do next we was in strange country now because we never had to run this fur before we had always killed before now now we had come to hog bayou that runs into the river a good fifteen miles below our camp
it had water in it not to mention a mess of down trees and logs and such and mister ernest checked dana gainsaying which way
i could just barely hear them off to the east a little like the old son of a gun had give up the idea of vicksburg or new orleans like he first seemed to have and had decided to have a look at alabama so i pointed and we turned up the bayou hunting for a crossing and maybe we could a found one except that i reckon mister ernest decided we never had time to wait we come to a place where the bayou had narrowed down to about twelve or fifteen feet and mister ernest said lookout im going to touch him and done it
i didnt even have time to freshen my holt when we was already in the air and then i seen the vine it was a loop of grapevine nig has big as my wrist looping downright across the middle of the bayou and i thought mister ernest seen it too and was jest waiting to grab it and fling it up over our heads to gounder it and i know dan seen it because he even ducked his head to jump under it
but mister ernest never seen it at all until its kun back along dans neck and hooked under the head of the saddle horn us flying on through the air the loop of the vine g it ting tighter and tighter until something somewhere was going to have to give
it was the saddle girth
it broke and dan going on and scrabbling up the other bank bare nek kid except for the bridle and me and mister ernest and the saddle mister ernest still setting in the saddle holding the gun and me still holding on to mister ernest s belt hanging in the air over the bayou in the tightened loop of that vine like in the draw ed back loop of a big rubber banded slingshot until it snapped back and shot us back across the bayou and fl angus clear me still holding on to mister ernest s belt and on the bottom now so that when we lit i would a had mister ernest and the saddle both on top of me if i had nt clu mb fast around the saddle and up mister ernest s side so that when we landed it was the saddle first then mister ernest and me on top until i jumped up and mister ernest still laying there with jest the white rim of his eyes showing
mister ernest
i hollered and the ncl umb down to the bayou and scooped my cap full of water and clu mb back and throw edit in his face and he opened his eyes and laid there on the saddle cussing me
god daw gi the said why didnt you stay behind where you started out
you was the biggest
i said
you would a mashed me flat
it might a been a signal a good by a farewell still walking we passed the other three old dogs in the middle of the glade laying down too and still that hundred yards ahead of them eagle too not laying down because he was still on his feet but his legs was spr addled and his head was down maybe jest waiting until we was out of sight of his shame his eyes saying plain as talk when we passed im sorry boys but this here is all
mister ernest stopped dan
jump down and look a this fee the said
nothing wrong with his feet i said
its his wind has done give out
jump down and look a this feet mister ernest said so i done it and while i was stooping over eagle i could hear the pump gun gos nick cluck
s nick cluck
s nick cluck three times except that in ever thought nothing then
maybe he was jest running the shells through to be sho it would work when we seen him again or maybe to makes ho they was all buckshot
then i got up again and we went on still walking a little west of north now because when we seen his white flag that second or two before the thicket hid it it was on a beeline for that notch in the bayou
and it was evening too now
the wind had done dropped and there was a edge in the air and the sun jest touched the tops of the trees
and he was taking the easiest way too now going straight as he could
when we seen his foot in the soft places he was running for a while at first after his rest
but soon he was walking too like he know ed too where eagle and the dogs was
and then we seen him again
it was the last time a thicket with the sun coming through a hole on to it like a searchlight
he crashed jest once then he was standing there broadside to us not twenty yards away big as a statue and red as gold in the sun and the sun sparking on the tips of his horns they was twelve of them so he looked like he had twelve lighted candles branched around his head standing there looking at us while mister ernest raised the gun and aimed a this neck and the gun went click
s nick cluck
click
s nick cluck
click
s nick cluck three times and mister ernest still holding the gun aimed while the buck turned and give us just one long bound the white underside of his tail like ablaze of fire too until the thicket and the shadows put it out and mister ernest laid the gun down slow and gentle back across the saddle in front of him saying quiet and peaceful and not much louder than jest breathing god daw g
god daw g
then it was morning tomorrow it was all over now until next november next year and we could comeback
uncle ike and willy and walter and roth and the rest of them had come in yes tid dy soon as eagle taken the buck out of hearing and they know ed that deer was gone to pack up and be ready to leave this morning for yo k napa taw pha where they lived until it would be november again and they could comeback so as soon a sweet breakfast simon run them backup the river in the big boat to where they left their cars and pickups and now it wasnt nobody but jest me and mister ernest setting on the bench against the kitchen wall in the sun mister ernest smoking a cigar a whole one this time that dan had nt had no chance to jump him through a grapevine and bust
he had nt washed his face neither when where that vine had th rowed him into the mud
but that was all right too his face usually did have a smudge of mud or tractor grease or beard stubble on it because he wasnt jest a planter he was a farmer he worked as hard a sara one of his hands and tenants which is why i know ed from the very first that we would gita long that i wouldnt have no trouble with him and he wouldnt have no trouble with me from that very first daywhen i woke up and maw had done gone off with that vicksburg roadhouse feller without even waiting to cook breakfast and the next morning pap was gone too and it was almost night and the next daywhen i heard a horse coming up and i taken the gun that i had already throw eda shell into the brit ch when pap never come home last night and stood in the door while mister ernest rid up and said come on
your pawa in t coming back neither
you mean he give me to you
i said
who cares
he said
come on
i brought a lock for the door well send the pickup back tomorrow for whatever you want
so i come home with him and it was all right it was jest fine his wife had died about three years ago without no women to worry us or takeoff in the middle of the night with adur n vicksburg roadhouse jake without even waiting to cook breakfast
and we would go home this afternoon too but not jest yet we always stayed one more day after the others left because uncle ike always left what grub they hadn tet and the rest of the homemade corn whisky he drunk and that town whisky of roth edmond zi zhe called scotch that smelled like it come out of a old bucket of roof paint setting in the sun for one more day before we went back home to g it ready to put in next years crop of cotton and oats and beans and hay and across the river yonder behind the wall of trees where the big woods started that old buck laying up in up today in the sun too resting today too without nobody to bother him until next november so atleast one of us was glad it would be eleven months and two weeks before he would have to run that fur that fast again
so he was glad of the very same thing we was sorry of and so all of a sudden i thought how maybe planting and working and then harvesting oats and cotton and beans and hay wasnt jest something me and mister ernest done three hundred and fifty one days to fill in the time until we could comeback hunting again but it was something we had to do to do honest and good during the three hundred and fifty one days to have the right to comeback into the big woods and hunt for the other fourteen and the fourteen days that the old buck run in front of dogs wasnt jest something to fill his time until the three hundred and fifty one when he didnt have to but the running and the risking in front of the guns and dogs was something he had to do for fourteen days to have the right not to be bothered for the other three hundred and fifty one
and so all the hunting and the farming wasnt two different things at all they was jest the other side of each other
yes i said
allweg otto do now is put in that next years crop
then november wont be no time away
you a in t going to put in the crop next year mister ernest said
you re going to school
so at first i didnt even believe i had heard him
what
i said
me
goto school
yes mister ernest said
you must take make something out of yourself
i ami said
im doing it now
im going to be a hunter and a farmer like you
no mister ernest said
that a in t enough anymore time was when all a man had to do was just farm eleven and a half months and hunt the other half
but not now
now just to belong to the farming business and the hunting business a in t enough
you got to belong to the business of mankind mankind
i said
yes mister ernest said
so you re going to school
because you got to know why
you can belong to the farming and hunting business and you can learn the difference between what s right and what s wrong and do right
and that used to be enough just to do right
but not now
you got to know why its right and why its wrong and be able to tell the folks that never had no chance to learn it teach them how to do what s right not just because they know its right but because they know now why its right because you just showed them told them taught them why
so you re going to school
its because you been listening to that d urn will legate and walter ewell
i said
no mister ernest said yes
i said
no wonder you missed that bucky est idd y taking ideas from the very feller s that let him gita way after me and you had run dan and the dogs d urn nigh clean to death
because you never even missed him
you never you never forgot to load that gun
you had done already you had done already unloaded it a purpose
i heard you
all right all right mister ernest said
which would you rather have
his bloody head and hide on the kitchen floor yonder and half his meat in a pickup truck on the way toyo k napa taw pha county or him with his head and hide and meat still together over yonder in that thicket waiting for next november for us to run him again
and g it him too i said
we wont even fool with no willy legate and walter ewell next time
maybe mister ernest said
yes i said
maybe mister ernest said
the best word in our language the best of all
that s what mankind keeps going on maybe the best days of his life a in t the ones when he said yes beforehand they re the ones when all he knew to say was maybe
he cant say yes until afterward because he not only dont know it until then he dont want to know yes until then



step in the kitchen and make me a toddy then well see about dinner
all right i said
i got up
you want some of uncle ike scorn or that town whisky of roth edmond zi z
cant you say mister roth or mister edmonds
mister ernest said
yes siri said
well which do you want
uncle ike scorn or that ere stuff of roth edmond zi z
thankyou very much mr faulkner in writing such a story as that which must be about concrete things that you ve experienced i dont know whether you ve had a collision with a grapevine or not when you were on a horse but do you see that kind of a story from beginning to end when you start writing
do you have that story sort of in mind the ending as part of the beginning
noi think a story like that invents itself as you go along
that one began with the with the picture of of that little boy been abandoned by his mother and his father
they were no good
and and by rights he should have been no good too
but this man mr ernest with all his ignorance could see that here is a human being and a human being is capable of anything if he has a chance to do it and and the story came out of the fact that this this crabbed old bachelor would see this this waif and suddenly say he s too valuable to leave in the woods there
and the story was simply a matter of showing incidences to show the relationship between these two people that this this oldman suddenly had seen a duty and was going to do it that he didnt know he d probably never been to school himself but he saw that something could be made out of this waif simply because that little waif was a human being sir in your own words in the beginning we were showing the hunt the way mr ernest took the boy this was showing how he she sort of took him in and how he took him on things that he went hunting or things like that and how he took him into his life
yes and the interdependence
the man was deaf
he couldnt hear which way the dogs went
this little boy would ride behind him and say they went that way
well then couldnt you perhaps put the part toward the end where he took the boy after his parents had gone away first say and then have the hunt come afterwards after we know that the that the man has taken the boy
and then could but i think that my way made a better story that s that s a matter of opinion but i think that mine to for the payoff to come last was a little more effective
if anything it makes the story seem a little more condensed shorter maybe but you had first in in mind the ending how it was
yes yes when you wrote your yes
well it was the relationship between these these two people
it was a bizarre relationship
the the story itself was simply an invention of of anecdotes to tell the story and they come out of of the storehouse which which any writer has of experience of observation of imagination that he reaches around in his work box and picks up whatever plank or board he will need you think it is always the little twist that comes from the imagination which really makes a kind of a story out of what is experienced that the additional thing which is really not experience which shapes it into some kind of story
i would say so
that that has to be there
its its something of of of gold in in the imagination which takes the trite familiar even dull incident and and gives gives it a shine one small point sir
you say a bayou
is that what we who dont live around them call a bayou
yes they would ve said bayou
when you were talking about the education being so that he could learn not only what was right but since he already knew what was right were you being was that supposed to be sort of comical
no
this uneducated ignorant man was fumbling after something which he had realized late in his life was not only true but important
that that no man can bean island to himself that you have a responsibility toward mankind
that is you may do right because through instinct or because its been beat into you but that maybe all right for you but you have a responsibility toward people that have not been trained to do right
they ve got to know why they must do right and only education can give you the the rhetoric the the capacity to think on your feet to explain to the to the ignorant the intractable why something is right why he must do something because its right
that was in fact the association with that child had had done that much to the man
if they had nt met the man would have gone on and would have been content to be crabbed and ignorant and a a hard farmer to make a little money every year but suddenly the responsibility of that child that man too had entered the human race
in away they were were to be the salvation of one another mutual salvation of one another
you think then that the boy will goto school
i should think so yes
he may will probably never be a phi beta kappa but this man will will see that he learns to read and write and and with the hope the idea that maybe once he learns to read he will of his own curiosity read enough to learn why man does right himself the the boy then will be changed by going to school and the man will be changed also by having the responsibility of this orphan
well the man would be changed by the responsibility of the orphan
the little boy at that age was pretty well started in the way he would go
all he needed was just an an occasional prod and some directing that already he was truthful and and brave and he was willing to give devotion fidelity
all he needed was education to learn to read to to know more of the history of his race
the man was probably changed more than that little boy was
the little boy was not changed so much as saved
then were they hunting not only the deer but in away themselves too
well of course they didnt know that but that s what they were finding
that is the man had in teaching the little boy that that never to touch satiety was valid
maybe he had never thought of that before that his notion was to take the two weeks off and get out there and and kill every deer that got up in front of him until suddenly his responsibility for the little boy made him stop and think well what is better to just drag the dead meat in or or to see the beautiful splendid creature run its native element
i thought i heard a little bit of a wistfulness for the time when a man didnt have to do anything but farm and hunt that maybe this you said time was when allman had to do was farm and hunt
surely nobody really likes responsibility
it maybe this man hated the fact that he couldnt stay in his home at night and goon to sleep and let that little boy which he knew was lost and abandoned in a in a hut in the woods to shift for himself but he couldnt
he had togo and get him
and yeshe probably thought it i wish we could goon like it used to be where people didnt have to be responsible where a man could bean island unto himself
but once he realized that he couldn the realized that neither could this little boy neither could any other human being that the responsibility the acceptance of the responsibility increased all of us just like the refusal of it diminished all of us
sir would you say that that s a major flaw in your old southern families that you picture like the sarto rises and the comp sons that they keep back from mankind and they act only for themselves and therefore turn in instead of out
if you mean by that s true of any family whether they are southern or not
they cling to an obsolescence whatever that obsolescence might be yes
and people have a tendency to remember what was pleasant and the unpleasant part of that vanishes as memory attenuates so that all you remember is the happy part of it and the instinct is togo back to that happy part
you dont always remember that if you went back to the happy part you d have togo through with the with the unhappy part again too
that s partly clinging to the happy past
its partly a lack of of something present to occupy
everybody in a sense needs a tub of washing and the people like the sarto rises and comp sons they dont have a tub of washing anymore
in the story your discussion are you equating having education to book learning
book learning is apart of education that i would say if i had to define education id say its a capacity to increase always to know more tomorrow than you knew today no matter where you get it from
you might get it from from playing poker or from farming or from going to school or from fighting
book learning of course is apart of education but book learning to my notion does not constitute education its nothing is of any value if you cant use it
if you cant use it not so much to make other people better tomorrow but to make yourself a little better tomorrow than you are to know more to be a little wiser to be more sure of of your own capacity to be honorable and brave
you concede that some education happens in the school
oh yes
oh yes so do you think then by going to school if he wanted to just hunt and and farm do you think he might have gone into something else now that he has gone to school and learned
i doubt it
he would have found out that what mr
ernest tried to tell him that to have the the right the privilege to do what you want for a fortnight in the year you ve got to do something for the other days that maybe you wont like that you have got to teach yourself or be taught discipline or nothing that you ever acquire will be any good to you if you dont have discipline
and togo to school a this age was mainly the discipline of something that must be done do you mean the process of him going to school is actually in the subjects that he would be taught he probably wouldnt learn anything that would be practical as far as him making a living or that s right
not until he found out for instance that he liked to read
once you discover you like to read then nobody really needs to worry about your book education anymore
you tend to that yourself unless you want to specialize in something
when you put that title down race at morning did you think of the appropriateness of that title on really various levels
that is the fact that the morning is the boy
the race means human race as well as the literal race in the hunt
you can interpret that title in various ways
i was just thinking about it as you were talking
no about the value of the title
no the title is in the little boys terms the morning of his life and it happened in the morning and i used the word race as to the ex ube ration the exuberance of of speed
that to him was that life at that age never does go slow
when it begins to slow up you get bored
its always at topspeed noi had nt thought of it in reference to humanity
it just it was his title his terms sir do you find it best that once you get an idea to s it right down and write it or is it best to think it over and sort of let it
after you have been properly snake bit with writing you dont have any sparetime to s it down and think something over
you get one idea while you re in the middle of of getting another one down and the new new idea has simply got to got to take its chance unless its as they say so hot at the moment that you will put down what you redoing to take it up
but probably some sort of a you might call it protective coloration that that idea dont come into the mind as new until subconsciously it has been hovered over for a while that it has begun to take its final shape before it ever comes into the conscious mind as an idea to write
that you dont know where you got it you dont knowhow long you ve had it that it it was an was an egg or or a hen that s been sitting over that single egg for the whatever length of time it takes to hatch the thing out before it comes into the conscious mind
when you think of stories gap in tape like this did in away before its really worth being developed
that s all right if it has but i think that the primary purpose of a story is first to be fun to the blok e writing it and the second to be fun to the blok e reading it
that if it has a message that s all right the message dont do any harm but you redoing something that you like to do its fun to do and if its done well if it was true its done the best you can in a a moving dramatic form it will please who reads it
the message is incidental
i that is what im trying to say is i dont think that any good story ever came because someone was trying to tell somebody a message with it
if he s got a message that worries him the best thing is to tell that message in the simplest sort of way instead of trying to invent a story to fit it because if the characters are true to themselves sometimes they might not believe in that message
they may take charge of the story so the message is you might say a byproduct of something that had had no concern with the message i was just wondering if you have this have a story then your purpose is more producing something that s enjoyable to be read but if it has a theme in it in order to focus on the theme in order to make the theme as as fully developed i should think you d have to keep that in mind keep what the if i understand you right in that case the message would be one of the craftsman stools
that well that s that s perfectly valid
a message is one of his tools just like the rhetoric just like the punctuation
that s quite valid but you dont write a story just to show your versatility with your tools
you write a story to tell about people man in his constant struggle with his own heart with the hearts of others or with his environment its its man in in the ageless eternal struggles which we inherit and we go through as though they ve never happened before shown for a moment in a dramatic instant of of the furious motion of being alive that s all any story is
you can catch this fluidity which is human life and you focus a light on it and you stop it long enough for people to be able to see it someone once remarked i dont know where i read i the said none of your characters ever made any conscious choice between good and evil
does that seem to you a true statement or not
i dont dont remember my characters that well i would have to read faulkner again is oic ant dispute that norn or agree with it
i dont believe i would agree with it offhand though but i cant cite you an instance
sir in order to be a good writer or a polished writer do you consider that writing must be a full time job or do you feel like you can have some of other business interest on the outside and also devote your sparetime to writing say
probably you re better off if you have other interests and maybe other compulsions
i think that the writer eventhough he he dont cant spend all his time writing he is never free of that demon which he invited or which took possession of him to live with him for the rest of his life that he s always writing
he may not carry carry a notebook with him but he s listening to terms of speech
he s struck by what people do to wonder why he did that why he didnt do the other
in that sense he never stops being a writer but he cant spend all his time at it because he might well probably would if he spent too much time a tithed begin to write nonsense balderdash
its always good never to write yourself out at anytime
its fine to need to stop and always stop as the book says while you re looking good
never write yourself to the end of a chapter or the end end of a thought always stop just before you get there to have something to start on next time
and if you have something else to do going to school a whole new job or raising a family or babysitting then you are anxious and eager enough to get back to the writing to where you will come at with a new head of steam sir when you find that if you were going to say put a message or a theme in a certain story that you would probably s it down and alter say perhaps the realistic events of what you ve seen in order to make it tell this message or the theme of which would alter the story say the hunter story there merely to put across a certain point
you cant do that
once the characters are realized they they take charge and they re going to do only what they re going to do
you cant do anything about it in other words first comes the story and then
that s right
that s right
that is most of of a mans private beliefs will appear sooner or later in his behavior his actions
the message i think comes from the story not from the authors private beliefs but from the characters in his story that the author is not telling you a message but the characters in the story have told you something that they believe is necessary that you know
because no author can be responsible for the ideas of his characters
do you think that one of the functions of writing is to not teach but to make the writer himself enjoy the life that he leads aside from his writing more fully
may i have that again please sir do you think that writing makes helps the writer or not doesnt help him but that the gap in tape they can learn more themselves and know more and enjoy life more fully
they do learn more as they write but i doubt if they write just to teach themselves
they write because its fun because some well fun is a bad term too but something has has struck them as being so true and so important and so moving that they ve got to do something with it and of course he does learn
he learns all the time he s writing just as the carpenter learns all the time he s building houses or stables but the writer writes because he is he is on fire with something an idea or a character that seems to him so true so moving that it wont let him rest
he s got to put it down
that s what i mean by fun
its fun is the wrong word its passion is a better word
i was wondering if your impression of the university has changed since the impressions you had before you came here
siri dont knowhow many of your characters but one atleast in requiem for a nun went here and so you must have had some impression of the university itself and i wonder if its changed since you ve actually been here
not really
a school with a with a tradition of behavior certain standards which which the undergraduates follow whether from choice or whether they are compelled to by the general atmosphere of the school changes only as as life itself changes
if you if you mean by change if there re more automobile sparked around the lawn and the grounds than there were thirty years ago yes the place has changed
but they are ephemeral changes
they re not too significant and dont have too much to do with with the what s basic in this school as a school and i doubt that there ever will be great changes
the great changing would have to come from some loosening of the of the strictures which control it the tenets not not so much the bylaws but the unspoken the moral tenets that this university functions within accepts not because its compelled but because they like it or it may have they may have found that that s the most practical
sir you said i believe last year that the sound and the fury was your best effort as a story
i was wondering if you have tried to use that narrative method again in other works
i would if the story im working at requires it
i think the story compels its own style to a great extent that the writer dont need to bother too much about style
if he s bothering about style then he she s going to write precious emptiness not necessarily nonsense but there ll it ll be quite beautiful and quite pleasing to the ear but there wont be much content in it that the story the characters they they have their own laws which the writer simply must follow
that they will elect what they re going to do and what they wont do
the story itself elects its own style
the writers job is merely to pick and choose between two more or less identical anecdotes
you wont need but one of them and he will chose the one that seems to him the most tragic or the funniest but the characters themselves are saying this is what i will door what i wont do
if the writer is going to force and compel them he s destroyed them that what he will windup with is something that he he himself will will never be satisfied with will get no pleasure from and a sive said before the end in writing is not for success and not really for glory its because its fun
of course any man likes to think of of glory but he would write if he knew that he would never be able to put his name on it
who was first
yes siri believe you are i think that the hour is up
i dont think the bells are working this morning
thankyou very much indeed mr faulkner
i appreciate your being here ever so much
were both given to stage fright i hope were bothwell enough known hereby now to where we dont need too much introduction
ami talking right you think
this would be addressed to young writers
its a suggestion more than an idea
two years ago president eisenhower conceived a plan based on an idea which is basically a sound one
this was that world conditions the universal dilemma of mankind at this moment are what they are simply because individual men and women of different races and tongues and conditions cannot discuss with one another these problems and dilemmas which are primarily their s but must attempt to do so only through the formal organizations of their antagonistic and seemingly irreconcilable governments
that is that individual people in all walks of life should be given opportunity to speak to their individual opposite numbers all over the earth laborer to laborer scientist to scientist doctors and lawyers and merchants and bankers and artists to their opposite numbers everywhere
there was nothing wrong with this idea
certainly no artist painter musician sculptor architect or writer would dispute it because this trying to communicate man to man regardless of race or color or condition is exactly what every artist has already spent all his life trying to do and as long as he breathes will continue to do
what doomed it in my opinion was symptom i zed by the phraseology of the presidents own concept laborer to laborer artist to artist banker to banker tycoon to tycoon
what doomed it in my opinion was an evil inherent in our culture itself
an evil quality inherent in and perhaps necessary though ido though i for one do not believe this last in the culture of any country capable of enduring and surviving through this period of history
this is the mystical belief almost a religion that individual man cannot speak to individual man because individual man can no longer exist
a belief that there is no place anymore where individual man can speak quietly to individual man of such simple things as honesty to oneself and responsibility toward others and protection for the weak and compassion and pity for all because such individual things as honesty and pity and responsibility and compassion no longer exist and man himself can hope to continue only by relinquishing and denying his individuality into a regimented group of his arbitrary factional kind arrayed against an opposite opposed arbitrary factional regimented group both filling the same air at the sametime with the same double barreled abstractions of peoples democracy and minority rights and equal justice and social welfare all the synonyms which take all the shame out of irresponsibility by not merely inviting but even compelling everyone to participate in it
so in this case i mean the presidents people to people committee the artist too who has already spent his life trying to communicate simply people to people the problems and passions of the human heart and how to survive them or anyway endure them has in effect been asked by the president of his country to affirm that mythology which has which he has already devoted his life to denying the mythology that one single individual man is nothing and can can have weight and substance only when organized into the anonymity of a group where he will have surrendered his individual soul for a number
it would be sad enough if only at such moments as this i mean formal recognition by his country of the validity of his lifes dedication did the artist have to run full tilt into what might be called almost a universal will to regimentation a universal will to obliterate the humanity from even from man even to the extent of relieving him not only of moral responsibility but even of physical pain and mortality by effacing his individuality into any it does not matter which as long as he has vanished into one of them nationally recognized economic group by profession or trade or occupation or income tax bracket or if nothing else offers finance company list
his tragedy is that today he must even combat this pressure waste some part of his puny but if he is an artist precious individual strength against this universal will to efface his individual humanity in order to bean artist
which comes at last to the idea i want to suggest which is what seems tome to be the one dilemma in which all young writers today participate
i think that perhaps all writers while they are hot working at topspeed to try to get said all they feel the terrific urgency to say dont read the writers younger after themselves
perhaps for the same reason which the sprinter or the distance runner has he does not have time to be interested in who is behind him or even up with him but only in who is in front
that was true in my own case anyway so there was a gap of about twenty five years during which i had almost no acquaintance whatever with contemporary literature
so when a short time a goi did begin to read the writing being done now i brought to it not only ignorance but a kind of innocence freshness what you might call a point of view and an interest virgin of preconceptions
anyway i got from the first story an impression which has repeated itself so consistently since that is hall offer it as a generalization
this is that the young writer of today is compelled by the present state of our culture which i tried to describe to function in a kind of vacuum of the human race
his characters do not function live breathe struggle in that moi land see the of simple humanity as did those of our predecessors who were the masters from whom we learned our craft dickens fielding thackeray conrad twain smollet t hawthorne melville james
their names are legion whose created characters were not just weaned but even spawned into am oil and see the of simple human beings whose very existence was an affirmation of an incurable and indomitable optimism men and women like our themselves understandable and comprehensible even when antipathetic al even in the very moment while they were murdering or robbing or betraying you since their s too were the same simple human lusts and hopes and fears uncomplicated by regimentation or group compulsion
am oil and see the of humanity into which they could venture not only un appalled and welcome but with pleasure too since with no threat of harm and with no threat of harm since the worst that could happen to them would be a headbutt by what was only another human head
an elbow or a knee skinned but that too was only another human knee or elbow which did the skinning
am oil and see the of mankind which accepted and believed in and functioned according not to angles but to moral principles
where truth was not where you were standing when you looked at it but was an unalterable quality or thing which could and would knock your brains out if you did not accept it or atleast respect it
while today the young writers characters must function not in individuality but in isolation not to pursue in myriad company the anguishes and hopes of all human hearts in a world of a few simple comprehensible truths and moral principles but to exist alone inside a vacuum of facts which he did not choose and cannot cope with and cannot escape from like a fly inside an inverted tumbler
let me repeat
i have not read all the work of this present generation of writing
i have not had time yet
so i must speak only of the one sido know
iam thinking now of what irate the best one salinger s catcher in the rye perhaps because this one expresses so completely what i have tried to say
a youth father to what will must someday beaman more intelligent than some and more sensitive than most who he would not even have called it by instinct because he did not know he possessed it because god perhaps had put it there loved man and wished to be apart of mankind humanity who tried to join the human race and failed
tome his tragedy was not that he was as he perhaps thought not tough enough or brave enough or deserving enough to be accepted into humanity
his tragedy was that when he attempted to enter the human race there was no human race there
there was nothing for him to do save buzz frantic and inviolate inside the glass wall of his tumbler until he either gave up or was himself by himself by his own frantic buzzing destroyed
one thinks of course immediately of huck finn another youth already father to what will someday soon now beaman
but in huck s case all he had to combat was his small size which time would cure for him in time he would be as big as any man he had to cope with
and even as it was all the adult world could do to harm him was to skin his nose a little humanity the human race would and was accepting him already
all he needed to do was just to grow up into it
that is the young writers dilemma as i see it
not just his but all our problems is to save mankind from being de soule das the stallion or boar or bull is gelded to save the individual from anonymity before it is too late and humanity has vanished from the animal called man
and who better to save mans humanity than the writer the poet the artist since who should fear the loss of it more since the humanity of man is the artists lifes blood
mr faulkner has consented to answer any questions you might have about this paper or about his works
so who shall lead the questions
in as i lay dying in the soliloquy of ad die bund ren she says that when she first met anse that he had a good farm and that he was on that farm and that he farmed it himself and one gets the impression that he was doing a pretty good job of it and yet when we see him in the book he sane erdo well
he he depends on his neighbors
i was wondering if there were was any implication that ad die might have sapped his will to work or his will to be a personality
noi wouldnt say so
i suspect that anse didnt like to farm anyway and he was just waiting until he could find a wife and get some children to do the work for him
and soon as he got some children to do the work he quit that s the sort of anse bund rens that im familiar within my country and i imagine he exists in virginia too
may i ask you what moved you to write that essay
i find it very profound
i reckon that anything you have devoted a great deal of your time to any sort of craft whether its an important one or not becomes pretty serious to you and maybe when you get along you think well i have if its not valid i have wasted a lot of pretty valuable time and so i prefer to believe that it is valid and it should continue and the people to carry it on are the people that come after me and if my thoughts about it are are worth anything whether they are or not it had better be expressed so the young people after me can take a look at them and say its nonsense or not
i suppose that s the reason
that no particular need to improve writing or to better mans condition maybe anymore than any artist has
i think maybe its not so much to better mans condition but maybe to uplift his heart to give him pleasure fun anyway it becomes important to the one who s spent all his life laying the brick and he wants the trade of bricklaying to continue
he does not need to be victim of it if he does not want to
he inherited this condition and possibly he himself knows there s something somewhere is wrong but he doesnt know what
it maybe someone who is old enough to have seen the other side of this nettle maybe able to tell him this is where the trouble is
no siri dont think that he s the victim of it
he simply inherited a condition which is not too good but but i doubt if anything can stop the artist from being an artist and i doubt if any condition economic or social or any other is going to prevent the good work being done that even without anybody to say this is what my hindsight tells me is wrong will will aid him well it will shorten the time maybe
he doesnt need to be told what s wrong
he will will solve that problem himself if he s going to keep working and the good one will keep working
is acm cc asl in in the bear relinquishes his heredity
do you think he maybe in the same predicament as modern man under the same conditions that he cant find a humanity that he can fit in with
well there are some people in anytime and age that cannot face and cope with the problems
there seems to be three stages
the first says this is rotten
ill have no part of it
i will will take death first
the second says this is rotten
i dont like it
i cant do anything about it but atleast i will not participate in it myself
i will go off into a cave or or climb a pillar to s it on
the third says this stinks and im going to do something about it
m cc asl in is the second
he says this is bad and i will withdraw from it
what we need are people who will say this is bad and im going to do something about it
im going to change it
there is a great problem of the status in the of the writer and the poet in our society
i think you have done a great deal to try to fix it
it occurs tome that after some thirty three years of im fifty two i started writing poetry when i was about eighteen when i was trying to find my way and really always felt a sort of shame in being a poet
until the other day a man of who mi consider a man of great dignity took me to his pupils who study poetry because i was a poet
now i must say he was a russian who had said at one time that russia the revolution killed its soul and he said this was a great tragedy for the country
now i think always in extremes of the poet and the writer society and i would suspect that in america we are more conservative in pushing against that enormous conservatism that is in opposition to the complete radicalism of the russian the opportunities ive had over the past few days
this country which is so really talented was a radical country a visionary country has now become crystalized and not writing so that the poet i see from my knowledge as a poet the poets in san francisco you may laugh at it their their manifesto is called howl
on the other hand we have our academic so called academic poets who are very tame because they dont howl
they dont knowhow to shriek and there s no guts in the middle
there area few people very few people who make the synthesis of the romantic and classic the liberal and conservative
yes i agree with that to an extent
i think that there re times when when the voice has more welcome to shout to howl than others but i think that the voice is still shouting and howling even if its inaudible im convinced that it would take a great deal more than any police state to suppress and destroy the heirs to dostoevsky and tolstoy
my belief is that they are still writing in russia
they have to hide it in the chimney or under the floor but they are still producing the books yes well very fortunately due to the death of stalin now the writers have been freed and there is a great flourishing and people were writing people like have been writing others has been writing novels and i cant evaluate them but my friend who knows the russian literature says they are distinguished works but there is another fact that in post revolution russia the artist has but the critics i think the critics are lacking have never honored their poets their visionaries are always well maybe so
i mim not too convinced that that has hurt the writing though has hurt the poet noi suppose the poetry
it would be it would be pleasanter if he did get recognition and were an integer or a definite integer in the culture of the country but but whether he is or no the s going to continue to be a poet and to dedicate his life and his breath to being a poet simply because that s what he likes
that s his cup of tea yes but its difficult the artist needs somehow
well yes
you surely dont mean that this modern dilemma which you ve described so well is concerned specifically for instance with the poets and artists
do you think humans do you think it applies just to the creative group of people or do you think it applies more widely
i think i would say that of course it applies to everybody but but the creative man will suffer from it
the young man that knows there s something wrong with what i doi dont know what it is but ido know there s something wrong
that s because he has not the perspective of an older persons hindsight to measure against
i yes i think anyone would be hurt
a a doctor would be a better doctor for being more of a humanitarian a better lawyer
i was thinking more of people who deal with the human spirit
that is the teacher not the doer but the teacher which are men in in the colleges the priests the artists whose whose craft whose vocation is showing man the splendor of his long history that a frail web of of flesh and bone mostly water stuck together in a ramshackle world held together by electricity which may collapse at any moment yet somehow he still believes in it and still gets fired up enough to produce poetic records of mans struggle which are still pleasing and still uplift the human hearts five hundred years after they were written done mr
faulkner
i wonder what you would say this current cycle of decay
well i dont quite like the word decay
i as i see it it was because of of overpopulation maybe and the mistakes of that we had made which broughton the wars have compelled people to coalesce in order to get along to live that more children are being born every year with no provisions to take care of the ones that we already have that the man who insists on being an eccentric and an individual is in everybody else s way
he s got to belong to something simply to keep the wheels running smooth which is fine for people to get along but that is bad for the artist for the man to paint in and compose the music and write the poetry what year was it around what year would you say this period began
oh around maybe in other words before the first worldwar
yes the seeds of it were implicit in the turn of the century though maybe it began well and the collapse of wall street
that may have been the first milepost of it though its hard to say just where it did begin
i would say that s was a sharp mark to measure from say maybe mr
faulkner
after the writer or poet has gotten the howl out of his system what in what way do you think that he can influence his society to become more individualistic
well if he s going to put in the time on influencing his society he a in t going to have much time left to be a good poet i think that he had better go ahead and and be a good poet and le this influence on society take care of itself but i think he that he is still got to write his poetry about the simple fundamental verities of of the human heart in conflict with itself not in conflict with labor unions nor with high prices nor with how ami going to get a cadillac when al live got now is a mercury
he s got to stick to the simple fundamental things which are the anguishes and troubles of his own aspirations and his failed capability and capacity to accomplish what he can dream
that s what the the music the poetry is about
its its not about economics nor belonging to groups nor liberal movements nor improving mankind because the artist really dont really give a damn about mankind
he s too busy
he s busy being an artist writing poetry or composing music taking pictures
yes sir
i think the poet would still be a poet
he d prefer to be a poet than to have the cadillac
there maybe a culture which would compel him to have that cadillac but he would be a poor cadillac owner just like he dbe a poor doctor or lawyer because he s going to be a poet first
could you compare wall street panics nope s and holden caulfield please
what advantages or qualities are there in wall street panic that holden caulfield has not now and never did have
wall street panic knew where he wanted togo
he knew that he could get there provided he observed a few of the rules of the game which he did and he got there
i think that wall street panic wasnt really as nope s that probably actually he was not as nope s that his fathers mama may have done a little extracurricular night work and that he really wasnt as nope s
he was a more of a simple human being than the others nope s were but he he wanted to be independent wanted to make money but he had rules about how he was going to do it
he wanted to make money by simple industry the old rules of of working hard and saving your pennies not by taking advantage of anybody could you contrast him please with to holden caulfield in catcher in the rye
well i think that they were completely different
there s almost no grounds that they would meet on
that caulfield was a sensitive young man that wanted to love man and couldnt find him
wall street panics nope s was going to get along with man but he didnt especially love man norn or did he have anything against man
he simply wanted to make a little money
he wanted success in in his own terms of of hard work industry which caulfield didnt
caulfield wanted to love man to be accepted by mankind and he couldnt because in his sensitive terms mankind wasnt there when he tried to touch it
you said earlier that holden caulfield s tragedy was the fact that mankind wasnt there or that holden caulfield didnt think he was there
he wasnt there i sometimes thought the tragedy of holden caulfield was that he did not fallin away that if he fell off into humanity he might ve found humanity
well he would have to have been tougher than he was
if he had been tougher than that there wouldnt have been any story in the first place but his story was an an intelligent very sensitive young man who was in this this day and time was an anachronism was almost an obsolescence trying to cope with and struggle with with the present day world which he was not fitted for
when he didnt want money
he didnt want position anything
he just wanted to find man and wanted something to love and he couldnt
there was nothing there
the nearest he came to it was his sister who was a child and and though she tried to love him she couldnt understand his problem
the only other human beings her an into he had preconceptions to doubt the teacher which could ve helped him and he suddenly began to suspect the teachers motives sir this sounds an awful lot like a novel called the sound and the fury with quentin comp son wanting to love people and the same sort of relationship with his sister
i dont quite agree with you
i dont believe that quentin and holden were very much a like in except in being a little too sensitive and coming from a somewhat similar background of of people that were were over intelligent but incapable of of any strength of of mutual affection and tenderness which as i got it was holden s home
yes sir there was that difference
yes that s right
that couldnt have been lived up to in anytime maybe
but holden caulfield was simply looking for something which should be everybody s right not only a privilege but everybody s right to find mankind and and love mankind and be accepted into mankind and he couldnt because mankind as i tried to say in my paper welcome
there s nothing to be said here tonight except that mr
william faulkner will read a selection from the spotted horses sir
i can see now this is going to become a very bad habit with me to stand up like this with a lot of nice people that don td are say shut up and s it down
this is about the horses
when the texan picking his teeth with a splintered kitchen match emerged from the house twenty minutes later the tethered wagons and riding horses and mules extended from the lot gate tovar ner s store and there were more than fifty men now standing along the fence beside the gate watching him quietly a little covertly as he approached rolling a little slightly bowlegged the high heels of his carved boots printing neatly into the dust
morning gents he said
here bud he said to the little boy who stood slightly behind him looking at the protruding butt of the pistol
he took a coin from his pocket and gave it to the boy
run to the store and get me a box of gingersnaps
he looked about at the quiet faces protuberant sucking his teeth
he rolled the match from one side of his mouth to the other without touching it
you boys done made your picks have you
ready to start her off hah
they didnt answer
they were not looking at him now
that is he began to have the feeling that each face had stopped looking at him the second before his gaze reached it
after a moment freeman said a in t you going to gap in tape wait for fl em
why
the texan said
then freeman stopped looking at him too
there was nothing in freeman s face either
there was nothing no alteration in the texans voice
eck you done already picked out yours
so we can start her off when you are ready
i reckon not eck said
i wouldnt buy nothing i was afraid to walk up to and touch
them little ponies
the texan said
you helped water and feed them
i bet that boy of yours could walk up to anyone of them
he better not let me catch him at it eck said
the texan looked at the quiet faces his gaze at once abstract and alert with an impenetrable surface quality like flint as though the surface were impervious or perhaps there was nothing behind it
them ponies is gentle as a dove boys
the man that buys them will get the best piece of horse flesh he ever forked or dr uv for the money
naturally they got spirit iain t selling crow bait besides who d want texas crow bait anyway with mississippi full of it
his stare was still absent and unwin king there was no mirth or humor in his voice and there was neither mirth nor humor in the single guffaw which came from the rear of the group
two wagons were now drawing out of the road at the sametime up to the fence
the men got down from them and tied them to the fence and approached
come up boys the texan said
you re just in time to buy a good gentle horse cheap
how about that one that cut your vest off night before last
a voice said
this time three or four guffawed
the texan looked toward the sound bleak and unwin king
what about it
he said
the laughter if it had been laughter ceased
the texan turned to the nearest gatepost and climbed to the top of it his alternate thighs deliberate and bulging in his tight trousers the butt of the pistol catching and losing the sun in pearly gleams
sitting on the post he looked down at the faces along the fence which were attentive grave reserved and not looking at him
all right he said
who s going to start her off with abid
step right uptake your pick and make your bid and when the last one is sold walkin that lot and put your rope on the best piece of horse flesh you ever forked or dr uv for the money there a in ta pony there that a in t worth fifteen dollars
young sound good for saddle or work stock guaranteed to outlast four ordinary horses you couldnt kill one of them with a axle tree there was a small violent commotion at the rear of the group
the little boy appeared burrowing among the motionless overalls
he approached the post the new and unbroken paper carton lifted
the texan leaned down and took it and tore the end from it and shook three or four of the cakes on to the boys hands a hand as small and almost as black as that of a coon
he held the carton in his hand while he talked pointing out the horses with it as he indicated them
look at that one with the three stocking feet and the frostbite ar watch him now when they pass again
look at that shoulder action that horse is worth twenty dollars of any mans money
who ll make me abid on him to start her off
his voice was harsh ready forensic
along the fence below him the men stood with button closet p their overalls the tobacco sacks and worn purses the sparse silver and frayed bills hoarded a coin at a time in the cracks of chimneys or chinked into the logs of walls
from time to time the horses broke and rushed with purposeless violence and huddled again watching the faces along the fence with wild mismatched eyes
the lane was full of wagons now
as the others arrived they would have to stop in the road beyond it and the occupants came up the lane on foot mrs little john came out of her kitchen
she crossed the yard looking toward the lot gate
there was a blackened wash pots eton four bricks in the corner of the yard
she built a fire beneath the pot and came to the fence and stood there for a time her hands on her hips and the smoke from the fire drifting blue and slow behind her
then she turned and went back into the house
come on boys the texan said
who ll make me abid
four bits a voice said
the texan didnt even glance toward it
or if he dont suit you how about that fiddle head horse without no mane to speak of
for a saddle pony id rather have him than this stocking foot
i heard somebody say fifty cents just now i reckon he meant five dollars didn the
doi hear five dollars
four bits for the lot the same voice said this time there were no guffaws
it was the texan who laughed harshly with only his lower face as if he were reciting a multiplication table
fifty cents for the dried mud of fen them horses he means he said
who ll give a dollar more for the genuine texas cockle burrs
mrs little john came out of the kitchen carrying the sawn half half of a wooden hogshead which she seton a stump beside the smoking pot and stood with her hands on her hips looking into the lot for a while without coming to the fence this time
then she went back into the house
what s the matter with you boys
the texan said
here eck you have been helping me and you know them horses
how about making me abid on that walleyed one you picked outlast night
here wait a minute
he thrust the paper carton into his other hip pocket and swung his feet inward and dropped cat light into the lot
the ponies huddled watched him
then they broke before him and slid stiffly along the fence
he turned them and they whirled and rushed back across the lot whereupon as though he had been waiting his chance when they should have turned their back son him the texan began to run too so that when they reached the opposite side of the lot and turned slowing to huddle again he was almost upon him upon them
the earth became thunderous dust arose out of which the animals began to burst like flushed quail and into which with that apparent unflagging faith in his own invulnerability the texan rushed
for an instant the watchers could see them in the dust the pony backed into the angle of the fence and the stable the man facing it reaching toward his hip
then the beast rushed at him in a sort of fatal and hopeless desperation and he struck it between the eyes with the pistol butt and felled it and leaped upon its prone head
the pony recovered almost at once and pawed itself to its knees and heaved at its prison ed head and fought itself up dragging the man with it for an instant in the dust the watchers saw the man free of the earth and in violent lateral motion like arag attached to the horses head
then the texans feet came back to earth and the dust blew aside and revealed them motionless the texans sharp heels braced into the ground one hand gripping the pony s forelock and the other its nostrils the long evil muzzle wrung backward over its scarred shoulder while it breathed in labored and hollow groans
mrs little john was in the yard again
noone had seen her emerge this time
she carried an armful of clothing and a metal ridged washboard and she was standing motionless at the kitchen steps looking into the lot
then she moved across the yard still looking into the lot and dumped the garments into the tub still looking into the lot
look him over boys the texan panted turning his own suffused face and the protuberant glare of his eyes toward the fence
look him over quick
them shoulders and he had relaxed for an instant apparently
the animal exploded again again for an instant the texan was free to the earth though he was still talking and legs you who a ill tear your face right look him over quick boys worth fifteen dollars of let me get a holt of who ll make me abid who a you blare eyed jackrabbit who a
they were moving now a kaleidoscope of inextricable and incredible violence on the periphery of which the metal clasps of the texans suspenders sun glinted in ceaseless orbit with terrific slowness across the lot then the broad clay colored hat soared deliberately outward an instant later the texan followed it though still on his feet and the pony shot free in mad stag like bounds
the texan picked up the hat and struck the dust from it against his leg and returned to the fence and mounted the post again
he was breathing heavily
still the faces didnt look at him as he took the carton from his hip and shook a cake from it and put the cake into his mouth chewing breathing harshly
mrs little john turned away and began to bail water from the pot into the tub though after each bucketfuls he turned her head and looked into the lot again
now boys the texan said
who says that pony a in t worth fifteen dollars
you couldnt buy that much dynamite for just fifteen dollars
there a in ta one of them cant do a mile in three minutes turn them into pasture and they will board themselves work them like hell all day and everytime you think about it lay them over the head with a single tree and after a couple of days every jackrabbit one of them will beast a meso tame you will have to put them out of the house at night like a cat
he shook another cake from the carton an date it
come one ck he said
start her off
how about ten dollars for that horse eck
what need i got for a horse i wouldnt i would need a bear trap to catch
eck said
didnt you just see me catch him
i seen you eck said
and i dont want nothing as big as a horse if i got to wr as tle with it everytime it finds me on the same side of a fence its on
all right the texan said
he was still breathing harshly but now there was nothing of fatigue or breathlessness in it
he shook another cake into his palm and inserted it beneath the moustache
all right
i want to get this auction started
iain t come here to live no matter how good a country you folks claim you got
im going to give you that horse
for a moment there was no sound not even that of breathing except the texans
you going to give it tome
eck said
yes provided you will start the bidding on the next one
again there was no sound save the texans breathing and then the clash of mrs little johns pail against the rim of the pot
i just start the bidding eck said
i dont have to buy it lessen iain t overtopped
another wagon had come up to the lane
it was battered and paint less
one wheel had been repaired by crossed planks bound to the spokes with baling wire and the two underfed mules wore a battered harness patched with bits of cotton rope there in s were ordinary cotton plow lines not new
it contained a woman in a shapeless gray garment and a faded sunbonnet andaman in faded and patched though clean overalls
there was not room for the wagon to draw out of the lane so the man left it standing where it was and got down and came forward a thin man not large with something about his eyes something strained and washed out at once vague and intense who shoved into the crowd at the rear saying what
what s that
did he give him that horse
all right the texan said
that walleyed horse with the scarred neck belongs to you
now
that one that looks like he s had his had his head in a flour barrel
what do you say
ten dollars
did he give him that horse did he give him that horse
the newcomer said
a dollar eck said
the texans mouth was still open for speech for an instant his face died so behind his hard eyes
a dollar
he said
one dollar
didi actually hear that
dur ni teck said
two dollars then
but iain twa it the newcomer said
you up there on the post
the texan looked at him
when the others turned they saw that the woman had left the wagon too though they had not known she was there until since they had not seen the wagon drive up
she came among them behind the man gaunt in the gray shapeless garment and the sunbonnet wearing stained canvas gymnasium shoes
she overtook the man but she did not touch him standing just behind him her hands rolled before her into the gray dress
henry she said in a flat voice
the man looked over his shoulder
get back to that wagon he said
here miss us the texan said
henry s going to get the bargain of his life in about a minute
here boys let them issus come up close where she can see henry s going to pick out that saddle horse them issus been wanting who says ten henry the woman said
she didnt raise her voice
she had not once looked at the texan
she touched the mansar m he turned and struck her hand down
get back to that wagon like it old you
the woman stood behind him her hands rolled again into her dress she was not looking at anything speaking to anyone
he a in tno more despair than to buy one of them things she said
and us not but five dollars away from the poorhouse he a in tno more despair
the man turned upon her with that curious air of leashed of dreamlike fury
the others lounged along the fence in attitudes gravely inattentive almost oblivious
mrs little john had been washing for sometime now pumping rhythmically up and down above the washboard in the sud foamed tub
now she stood erect again her soap raw hands on her hips looking into the lot
shut your mouth and get back to that wagon the man said
do you want me to take a wagons take to you
he turned and looked up at the texan
did you give him that horse
he said
the texan was looking at the woman
then he looked at the man still watching him he tilted the paper carton over his open palm
a single cake came out of it
yeshe said
is the fellow that bids into this next horse going to get that first one too
no the texan said
all right the other said
are you going to give a horse to the man that makes the first bid on the next one
no the texan said
then if you was just starting the auction by giving away a horse why didnt you wait till we were all here
the texan stopped looking at the other
he raised the empty carton and squinted carefully into it as if it might contain a precious jewel or perhaps a deadly insect
then he crumpled it and dropped it carefully beside the post on which he s at
eck bids two dollars he said
i believe he still think she s bidding on them scraps of bob wire they come here in instead of one of them horses
but i got to accept it
but are you boys so eck s going to get two horses at a dollar ahead the newcomer said
three dollars
the woman touched him again he flung her hand off without turning and she stood again her hands rolled into her dress across her flat stomach not looking at anything
mister she said we got chaps in the house that never had shoes last winter
we a in t got corn to feed the stock
we got five dollars i earned weaving by fire light after dark
and he a in tno more despair
henry bids three dollars the texan said
raise him a dollar eck and the horse is yours
beyond the fence the horses rushed suddenly and for no reason and as suddenly stopped staring at the faces along the fence
henry the woman said
the man was watching eck his stained and broken teeth showed a little beneath his lip
his wrists dangled into fists below the faded sleeves of his shirt too short from from many washing s
four dollars eck said
five dollars
the husband said raising one clenched hand
he shouldered himself forward toward the gatepost
the woman didnt follow him
she now looked at the texan for the first time
her eyes were a washed gray also as though they had faded too like the dress and the sunbonnet
mister she said if you take that five dollars i earned my chaps a weaving for one of them things it ll be a curse on you and yours during all the time of man
five dollars
the husband shouted
he thrust himself up to the post his clenched hand on a level with the texans knees
he opened it upon awad of frayed banknotes and silver
five dollars
and the man that raises it will have to beat my head of for ill be a this n
all right the texan said
five dollars is bid
but dont you shake your hand at me
at five o clock that afternoon the texan crumpled the third paper carton and dropped it to the earth beneath him
in the copper slant of the leveling sun which fell also upon the line of limp garments in mrs little johns backyard and which cast his shadow and that of the post on which he s at long across the lot where now and then the ponies still rushed in purposeless and tireless surges the texan straightened his leg and thrust his hand into his pocket and took out a coin and leaned down to the little boy
his voice was now hoarse spent
here bud he said
run to the store and get me a box of gingersnaps
the men still stood along the fence tireless in their overalls and faded shirts
fl ems nope s was there now appeared appeared suddenly from nowhere standing beside the fence with a space the width of three or four men on either side of him standing there in his small yet definite isolation chewing tobacco in the same gray trousers and minute bow tie in which he had departed last summer but in a new cap gray too like the other but new and overlaid with a bright golfers plaid looking also at the horses in the lot
all of them two save two had been sold for sums ranging from three dollars and a half to eleven and twelve dollars
the purchasers as they had bid them in had gathered as though by instinct into a separate group on the other side of the gate where they stood with their hands lying upon the top strand of the fence watching with a still more sober intensity the animals which some of them had owned for seven or eight hours now but had not yet laid hands upon
the husband henry stood beside the post on which the texans at
the wife had gone back to the wagon where she s at gray in the gray garment motionless looking at nothing still she might have been something inanimate which he had loaded on to the wagon to move it somewhere waiting now in the wagon until he should be ready togo on again patient insensate timeless
i bought a horse and i paid cash for i the said his voice was harsh and spent too the mad look in his eyes had had a quality glazed now and even sightless
and yet you expect me to stand around here till they are all sold before i can get my horse
well you can do all the expecting you want
im going to take my horse out of there and go home
the texan looked down at him
the texans shirt was blotched with sweat
his big face was cold and still his voice level
take your horse then
after a moment henry looked away
he stood with his head bent a little swallowing from time to time
a in t you going to catch him forme
it a in t my horse the texan said in that flat still voice
after a while henry raised his head
he didnt look at the texan
who ll help me catch my horse
he said
nobody answered
they stood along the fence looking quietly into the lot where the ponies huddled already beginning to fade a little where the long shadow of the house lay upon them deepening
from mrs little johns kitchen the smell of frying ham came
a noisy cloud of sparrows swept across the lot and into a china berry tree beside the house and in the high soft vague blue swallows stooped and swirled in erratic in decision their cries like strings plucked at random
without looking back henry raised his voice bring that ere plow line
after a while the wife moved
she got down from the wagon and took a coil of new cotton rope from it and approached
the husband took the rope from her and moved toward the gate
the texan began to descend from the post stiffly as henry put his hand on the latch
come on here he said his wife had stopped when he took the rope from her
she moved again obediently her hands rolled into the dress across her stomach passing the texan without looking at him
dont you go in the remiss us he said
she stopped not looking at him not looking at anything
the husband opened the gate and entered the lot and turned holding the gate open but without raising his eyes
come on here he said
dont you go in the remiss us the texan said
the wife stood motionless between them her face almost concealed by the sunbonnet her hands folded across her stomach
i reckon i better she said
the old the other men did not look a the rat all at her or henry either
they stood along the fence grave and quiet and inattentive almost bemused
then the wife passed through the gate the husband shut it behind them and turned and began to move toward the huddled ponies the wife following in the gray and shapeless garment within which she moved without inference of locomotion like something on a moving platform afloat
the horses were watching them
they clotted and blended and shifted among themselves on the point of breaking though not breaking yet
the husband shouted at them
he began to curse them advancing the wife following
then the huddle broke the animals moving with high stiff knees circling the two people who turned and followed again as the herd flowed and huddled again at the opposite side of the lot
there he is the husband said
get him into that corner
the herd divided the horse which the husband had bought jolted on stiff legs
the wife shouted at it it spun and poised plunging then the husband struck it across the face with the coiled rope and it whirled and slammed into the corner of the fence
keep it there now the husband said
he shook out the rope advancing
the horse watched him shouted wild glaring eyes it rushed again straight toward the wife she shouted at it and waved her arms but it soared past her in along bound and rushed again into the huddle of its fellows
they followed and hemmed it again into the other corner again the wife failed to stop its rush for freedom and the husband turned and struck her with the coiled rope
why didnt you head him
he said
why didnt you
he struck her again she didnt move not event of end the rope with a raised arm
the men along the fence stood quietly their faces lowered as though brooding upon the earth at their feet
only fl ems nope s was still watching if he ever had been looking into the lot at all standing in a little island of isolation chewing with his characteristic faint sidewise thrust beneath the new plaid cap
the texan said something not loud harsh and short he entered the lot and went to the husband and jerked the uplifted rope from his hand
the husband whirled as though he were about to spring at the texan crouched slightly his knees bent and his arms held slightly away from his sides though his gaze never mounted higher than the texans carved and dusty boots
then the texan took the husband by the armand led him back toward the gate the wife following and through the gate which he held open for the woman and then closed
he took awad of banknotes from his trousers and removed a bill from it and put it into the womans hand
get him into the wagon and get him on home he said
what s that for
fl ems nope s said
he had approached
he now stood beside the post on which the texan had been sitting
the texan didnt look at him
think she bought one of them ponies the texan said
he spoke in a flat still voice like that of a man after a sharp run
get him on away miss us
give him back that money the husband said in his lifeless spent tone
i bought that horse and i aim to have him if i got to shoot him before i can put a rope on him
the texan did not even look at him
get him on away from here miss us he said
you take your money and i take my horse the husband said
he was shaking slowly and steadily no was though he were cold
his hands open and shut below the frayed cuffs of his shirt
give it back to him he said
you dont you don town no horse of mine the texan said
get him on homem issus
the husband raised his spent face his mad glazed eyes
he reached out his hand
the woman held the banknote in her folded hands across her stomach
for a while the husbands shaking hand merely fumbled at it
then he drew the banknote free
its my horse he said
i bought it
these fellows saw me
i paid for it
its my horse
here
he turned and extended the banknote towards nope s
you got something to do with these horses
i bought one
here s the money for it
i bought one
ask him
s nope s took the banknote
turning pages they re in the lot again still trying to catch the horses
this is eck and the little boy
watch out paw
the boy said
there he is
there sour n
it was the one the texan had give neck
catch him paw
get out of my way eck said
get back to that wagon
the line was still advancing
the ponies milled clotting forced gradually backward toward the open door of the barn
henry was still slightly in front crouched slightly his thin figure even in them azy moonlight emanating something of that spent fury
the splotchy huddle of animals seemed to be moving before the advancing line of men like a snowball which they might have been pushing before them by some invisible means gradually nearer and nearer to the back black yawn of the barn door
later it was obvious that the ponies were so intent upon the men that they did not realize that the barn was even behind them until they backed into the shadow of it
then an indescribable sound a movement of desperate and despairing arose among them for an instant of static horror men and animals faced one another then the men whirled and ran before a gaudy vomit of long wild faces and splotched chests which overtook and scattered them and flung them sprawling aside and completely obliterated from sight henry and the little boy neither of whom had moved though henry had flung up both arms still holding his coiled rope the herd sweeping on across the lot to crash through the gate which the last man through it had neglected to close leaving it slightly ajar carrying all of the gate save the upright to which the hinges were nailed with them and so among the teams and wagons which choked the lane the teams springing and lunging too snapping hitch reins and tongues
then the whole inextricable mass crashed among the wagons and eddied and divided about the one in which the womans at and rushed on down the lane and into the road dividing one half going one way and one half the other
the men in the lot except henry got to their feet and ran toward the gate
the little boy once more had not been touched not even thrown off his feet for a while his father held him clear of the ground in one handshaking him like a ragdoll
didnt i tell you to stay in that wagon
eck cried
didnt i tell you
lookout paw
the boy chattered out of the violent shaking
there sour n
there he goes
it was the horse the texan had given them again
it was as if they owned no other the other one did not exist as if by some absolute and instantaneous rapport of blood they had relegated to oblivion the one for which they had paid money
they ran to the gate and down the lane where the other men had disappeared
they saw the horse the texan had given them whirl and dash back and rush through the gate into mrs little johns yard and run up the front steps and crash once on the wooden veranda and vanish through the front door
eck and the boy ran upon to the veranda
a lamps at on a table just inside the door
in its mellow light they saw the horse fill the long hallway like a pinwheel gaudy furious and thunderous
a little further down the hall there was a varnished yellow melodeon
the horse crashed into it it produced a single note almost a chord in bass resonant and grave of deep and sober astonishment the horse with its monstrous and antic shadow whirled again and vanished through another door
it was a bedroom ratliff in his underclothes and one sock and with the other sock in his hand and his back to the door was leaning out the open window facing the lane the lot
he looked back over his shoulder
for an instant he and the horse glared at one another
then he sprang through the window as the horse backed out of the room and into the hall again and whirled and saw eck and the little boy just entering the front door eck still carrying his rope
it whirled again and rushed on down the hall and on to the back porch just as mrs little john carrying an armful of clothes from the line and the washboard mounted the steps
get out of here you son of a bitch she said she struck with the washboard it divided neatly on the long mad face and the horse whirled and rushed backup the hall where eck and the boy now stood
get to hell out of here wall
eck roared he dropped to the floor covering his head with his arms
the boy didnt move and for the third time the horse soared over the unwin king eyes and the un bowed and untouched head and on to the front veranda again just as ratliff still carrying the sock came around the corner of the house and up the steps the horse whirled without breaking or pausing
he galloped to the end of the veranda and took the railing and soared outward hobgoblin and floating in the moon
it landed in the lot still running and crossed the lot and galloped through the wrecked gate and among the overturned wagons and the still intact one in which henry s wife stills at and on down the lane and into the road
a quarter of a mile further on the road gashed pallid and moon y between the moon y shadows of the bordering trees the horse still galloping galloping its shadow into the dust the road descending now toward the creek and the bridge
it was of wood just wide enough for a single vehicle
when the horse reached it it was occupied by a wagon coming from the opposite direction and drawn by two mules already asleep in the harness and the soporific motion
on the seat was tull and his wife in splint chairs in the wagon behind them s at their four daughters all returning belated from an all day visit with some of mrs tull skin
the horse neither checked nor swerved
it crashed once on the wooden bridge and rushed between the two mules which waked lunging in opposite directions in the traces the horse now apparently scrambling along the wagon tongue itself like a mad squirrel and scrambling at the end gate of the wagon with its forefeet as if it intended to climb into the wagon while tull shouted at it and struck at its face with his whip
the mules were now trying to turn the wagon around in the middle of the bridge
it slewed and tilted the bridge rail cracked with a sharp report above the shrieks of the women the horse scrambled at last across the back of one of the mules and tull stood up in the wagon and kicked at its face
then the frontend of the wagon rose flinging tull there in snow wrapped several times about his wrist backward into the wagon bed among the overturned chairs and the exposed stockings and undergarments of his women
the pony scrambled free and crashed again on the wooden planking galloping again
the wagon lurched again the mules had finally turned it on the bridge where there was not room for it to turn and were now kicking themselves free of the traces
when they came free they snatched tull bodily out of the wagon
he struck the bridge on his face and was dragged for several feet before the wrist wrapped reins broke
far up the road now distancing the frantic mules the pony faded on
while the five women still shrieked above tull s unconscious body eck and the little boy came up trotting eck still carrying his rope
he was panting
which way d he go
he said
audience laughter in the now empty and moon drenched lot his wife and mrs little john and ratliff and lumps nope s the clerk and three other men raised henry out of the trampled dust and carried him into mrs little johns backyard
his face was blanched and stony his eyes were closed the weight of his head tau ten ed his throat across the protruding larynx his teeth glinted dully beneath his lifted lip
they carried him on toward the house through the dappled shade of the china berry trees across the dreaming and silver night a faint sound like remote thunder came and ceased
there s one of them on the creek bridge one of the men said
its that one of eck s another said
the one that was in the house
mrs little john had preceded them into the hall
when they entered with henry she had already taken the lamp from the table and she now stood beside an open door holding the lamp high
bring him in here she said
she entered the room first and set the lamp on the dresser
they followed with clumsy scuffling s and panting s and laid henry on the bed and mrs little john came to the bed and stood looking down at henry s peaceful and bloodless face
ill declares he said
you men
not only a privilege but everybody s right to find mankind and love mankind and be accepted into mankind and he couldnt because mankind as i tried to say in my paper in holden s terms wasnt there anymore
sir mankind as you say wasnt there
that in this time well it isnt
the problem is in things before these would you say like hamlet or times past these same conditions point man has always struggled to find mankind and often he cant do it
its sort of universal
except its only now in history that man has been compelled into groups that there was noway for him to exist unless he belonged to a group that everybody has to belong to a group
if its a not a union not a trade union not a guild of course they existed five hundred years ago but now everybody a teacher has got to belong to a group its its got to be a phi beta kappa badge or got to bean income tax bracket or if nothing else as i said it show many installments he still owes on his icebox or his car that nobody belongs to himself anymore
he belongs to a finance company or a group or an organization
if he dont there s no place for him would you believe that this system it seems tome that this is a certain class of people and it may prevail because we have television
we have certain standardization s
but i still think there areas many individuals growing up no was there were in times before
i would like to think so
im afraid though that it takes so much of a mans time to bean individual now that he dont have very much left be a poet
how does a man who works in a chewing gum factory in detroit communicate with a man who shepherds sheep in algeria
lets say that they re both simple pensive men and you put them together
this is the man to man confrontation that you speak of
on what terms can they communicate
its almost impossible because the only way two people can communicate is to meet one another in in quiet
i dont think they can do it over any artificial means of of communication like radio or or telephone
they ve got to meet face to face because only a very small part of communication is from speech and how a man in detroit and an algerian shepherd can can meet i dont know but all they need to do to communicate is to meet in solitude and peace i think
to s it on the same sandhill together for a while but the pressure is against that that people must nt do that
they must function through committees with slogans and catchphrases polysyllabic abstractions that really mean nothing dont you think nowadays that possibly there area great many individuals whom whom you dont recognize as individuals because they dont dont seem to be doing anything and that s where they are individuals they re not belonging
they re not necessarily worrying about the next
i hope so
i hope there area lot of them
i dont know very many of them that are that are free of the pressure to belong to something
there maybe some
i would like to know that there area great many of them well i should think that probably in in the teaching world in universities and colleges there might be more than elsewhere
would you disagree with that
noi would say that there would be
that is the best the happiest place for the man to bean individual is in college
you re saying the solution is talk to everybody
yes id like to suggest that this talk has been profoundly true as i recall a white paper if you ll examine earlier propaganda you will find an appeal to the individual the individual by the millions very much to the individual ashes its in a bazar in baghdad or or in calcutta in his own language as for one individual to another that is where i think that they have their big success
yes sir but but a in t most of that telling the individual something its not saying to the individual talk tome
its saying listen tome
that s the trouble with all propaganda no sir it is not if i may contradict that
i think the african is very much invited to talk and the proof of it that she talking today in ghana
well i certainly hope you re right and i would say that your mass manisa creation of western civilization
i dont think he exists in india
i must say individual of the individual which is probably so intense
there again i was very much struck
i couldnt help wondering whether all this about the howling and the hardship of the present generation couldnt be found very much more profoundly if you look at the lives of the poets and the lives of dickens and the hardships
arent we merely basing ourselves upon the cadillac standard
he doesnt have any ideals
isnt that the point im trying to make that our culture is founded on the cadillac ideal yes that s where i agree with you
to in form you how howl juxtaposed to the academics i suppose
now my point is that these are extremes of the arts
one is the breaking away which is not true howl not speech and i juxtapose this to the academic poets and i think we used the term a just a shrill shriek
now this is not speech
speech is somewhere in the middle
yes that s right
i agree with that you re not breaking it up and you re not holding it back but you re comfortable
i think our culture is accustomed extremes perhaps its waiting for the poet in the middle before it starts talking and talking background of the san francisco poets
they seem to get together in a group and play music and generally carouse while they create and i was wondering how this would fit in with your ideas that the artist is an individual
can they be individuals when they recreating as a group
o him sure he can
his his pursuits in his sparetime wouldnt have to do with his attitude toward his own freedom as freedom is no good to you if you can tits worth nothing if you cant relinquish it now and then use it the only way you can test that you ve got it is to see how far it will go can i say one more thing
the poets in san francisco are unlearned
they ve not read the great s they ve not read their predecessors in literature and they resist any kind of learning and it seems tome all the great poets all the great writers have read and know their style and these dont
and i would say that the academic poets are over read and have no vitality
these people have all the vitality and no control and the others are over controlled
where are the middle people in the poems that i read and the novels i read sir do you think economically hard times could aid creative energy
people cant goon buying pricey cars and living and it seems like a little more aggressive spirit
in times like this if there were a real recession it might not harm some of the individualism that seems to die if there is plenty of everything
do you agree at all
i dont know whether that would would produce any anymore and better poetry
more people might buy what poetry is for sale
that that is if they couldnt buy the cadillac s and nobody likes to s it down and just think
he has to do something with himself so maybe they may even buy poetry at the last but it wouldnt make people write any better poetry i think
no sir
no siri dont think so
well i mean what i thought i said
im sorry
maybe i dont understand your question
no sir
ive never said that
i was simply pointing out to the young writer what i believe was his trouble he knows there s something wrong but maybe he has nt seen this that i was simply trying to show him what a little more experience than he has suggested tome maybe the trouble that he himself without knowing it is constricted too much by the regimentation necessary for a nation to sacrifice as much as nations have to to oppose two antipathetic ideologies that im convinced that the poet can do his bit toward supporting the manufacture of of a bombs and things like that if that is necessary and can still be a good poet
im convinced too that if anyone is to bring us to some sense its not going to be the people that make the a bombs nor sell the cadillac s
it ll be the poets the artists
i still dont think he needs to worry about that
if if he is writing of the struggles of the human heart in conflict with itself or with others or with its environment hell be writing in the recognizable terms which people have all met in their own private dilemmas
well we would say that everyman has what you have called his own private world but if he does not write about that in recognizable terms in terms which everybody else can apply to his and her own private world then its not going to be of much value that he s got to write of his own private world in universal terms
that s what i mean by the eternal simple few verities which mans heart anguishes over they are recognizable by anyone who wouldnt recognize the the culture and the economy of of
he would have to translate that into his own terms but these verities that is peak of the the simple truth would be recognized by by anyone of any age of anytime which i think is the reason that the good music good poetry the good pictures dont have any date because anyone recognizes them
they re still true what they were talking about no matter what costume they wore
isnt it possible though that these eternal verities maybe spoken of in certain styles addressed to contemporaries and yet misunderstood and therefore neglected arent there arent there writers who are addressed by their contemporary audiences who are totally neglected because of the of the manner in which they were addressed and not because of the subject matter
i dont know sir
its seemed that gap in tape in recognizable terms there ll always be somebody to read it
i mean by recognizable terms you can write along treatise about honesty and your audience will goto sleep in a few minutes but if you write about honesty in some dramatic form in terms of recognizable people then the audience will stay awake to see what happened to them whether they got away with be being dishonest or whether honesty paid
that s what i mean by recognizable terms that if you write in a in a language an essay people wont listen because its not familiar but if you write in terms of people in motion they will listen and they will learn
the the poet can talk to people that way when they wouldnt listen to him at all if he wrote a speech or an essay how do you feel about the hamlet being made into a movie and did you work on the script of that
no im not a moving picture man and dont probably dont really care for pictures
oh i see one occasionally but is up poseidon t take moving pictures very seriously
maybe they come at the wrong time of day togo to see
and they make too much noise to oid rather s it down with a book and read it than to listen to something that is the great medium it seems for the artist
shakespeare shakespeare who speaks to all people to the people who can tread
that s right
what s against it is it costs too much money
its impossible for one man to have the camera and the film and to make exactly what he thinks is right and true to make
you can do that with a dollars worth of paper and a nickel pencil but you cant do with that film
it costs too much
did you say that the highest form of endeavors is not to s it back and say well i wont be apart of this but its saying that its is sad and im going to do something about it
how how do you reconcile this to what you say the fact that the writer shouldnt care whether he makes any effect on society
oh that s easy because you cant the one thing that man can do for eight hours a day is work but you cant work even longer than eight hours a day
you can be are former but you dont need to be a poet at the sametime
you ll be a poet for eight hours and be are former for eight hours and sleep for eight hours its there s there s no reason why they should ever conflict
if you try to be are former and a poet at the sametime then you re going to be writing propaganda which stops being poetry i disagree with you
some of the greatest poetry in the english literature is didactic
its teaching preaching poetry
i mean wordsworth was one of the mi think
i think we underrate the the didactic element in poetry
wouldnt you have liked his poetry if he were not preaching yes but i think that i think we need to come again to an appreciation of his didacticism
i think its a time again almost for preaching poetry
well that swell maybe a poet could be be happier being a preacher and a poet too but i think that he s primarily either a poet or primarily either a preacher and if he s got to try to bebo that the sametime one is going to suffer well i dont know
i like your fable very much and admire it as a great great novel but i think its a a terrible sermon a frightening sermon
i use the word terrible as you do
it wasnt intended to be a sermon
that is it was a matter of indifference to the writer whether it was a sermon or not
he was simply writing about something that seemed seemed true and moving to him sir last spring you spoke of the work of when you were asked of williams tyr on and shelby foote and warren ey ster as young writers whose novels elicited some approval from you
they seemed promising writers
do you think that the fact that they as far as i know write do not write about cities gives them more of a possibility for showing the human heart in conflict with itself
i would say that in a city the to belong to conform that i spoke of is more apparent not necessarily more prevalent but there s there s there s more space between you and and the wall of pressure in the country where there is not so much fewer people but but fewer of the constant symptoms of of belonging of being grouped of being pressed
i dont think that their work is any better because they they they write about the country
i think that tome that work too reflects the same thing that the characters dont participate in that free almost jolly ordinary moi land see the of simple people that the characters of of dickens everytime they stepped outdoors they were in it
they were right in the middle of the human race
every simple act they performed they were in the middle of mankind the human race which the characters in the books today dont seem to be able to attain you d feel that salinger for example just has nt created enough characters who seem to be apart of this big human race
there isnt just a there just isnt enough for holden caulfield to come in contact with before he can get anywhere
he couldnt get to them
he tried
there was the chance with the professor that understood him and and could have helped him but there he had right in there he had run into a preconception which was foisted on him that everyman if if he s not happily married he must be homosexual
that s the pressure to belong to a group to be typed that you cant be yourself you ve got to belong to something
if he if her an into two people that should have been apart of the of them oil and see the of of simple people which i spoke about that was the prostitute and the pimp and the only point they met on was that shabby five dollar bill that there was no human contact otherwise even when the man hit him it might have been a door swinging into him
there s nothing human in it
the only human contact he could reach was with his little sister who was too young to see that she knew that he was in trouble but she had no conception of of what the anguish and trouble was mr
faulkner before you spoke about when you gave your list of the great masters you seemed to end with twain and with james and then later when you spoke about the subject of our cycle of decadence you named the years
do you think it maybe possible that there is a coincidence between that time and the beginning of the cycle if indeed there is one and the works of such great european masters as joyce proust mann gi de the people who seem to deal with fiction in an interior i zing way as opposed to the outdoor world of such earlier masters that you mentioned like fielding smollet t
i would say that the people who had matured as writers by had the same concept of of the world of humanity as the people two hundred years ago but since the young man who had no actual experience of that world had no concept of it that he had has been born into a different world that the world he is born into is the world that is enclosed by all the subtle pressure to belong to something whatever the reason that everyone must belong to something is not the point that i was trying to make
the fact is that it seems tome it is there that if you re going to bean eccentric the first thing you know you re going to be lumped with a group of eccentrics but isnt it just as greatly pronounced in the th century novels both english and french dickens great expectations or stendhal s red and the black the heroes in both of those novels arent they betrayed once they tried to touch out or reach out and touch society
yes sir but the society they touched was am oil and see the of simple people
when the character nowadays reaches out to touch something he he touches a formula
he touches something that s called labor or called peoples democracy or social welfare or communism or anti communism or citizens council
he s dont touch just am oil and see the of simple people functioning on mans own simple desires to have fun at no cost or as little costas possible
sir do you feel that the code of southern chivalry as abroad moral way of life broad basis for amoral way of life was ever anymore than a romantic dream or romantic ideal
i would say it was moral standards which man over along period of time has found to be the be stones for himself and for everyone else which had got colored over with a certain amount of romanticism and by certain participants in it had come to be accepted the romanticism i mean as the most valid part of it
that if you were romantic and gallant about it it didnt matter whether you were moral about it or not
in that sense it it was obsolescent and its a good thing it is past but im convinced it was based on simple standards of of good decent behavior which would be valid at anytime
sir in the bear is there any intended symbolism in ike m cc asl in taking on the profession of carpenter rather than store clerk or or training training in some other profession
not symbolism on my part but probably on on ike s part in that the symbols which the writer puts into his work are the same symbols which the reader reads into it
that is they come from a christian background
it maybe that ike without stopping to rationalize it had deliberately assumed the symbol of of christ as a protest against an evil which he could not and would not condone
he probably at that moment didnt have time to hunt around and say oh lets see what shall ido
ill do something that christ did
he just said that i willi will become a carpenter
he didnt go through the process of remembering this was the symbology which he had inherited from the moment his mama taught him to say his prayers at night
that was apart of his literate background
was your purpose in the bear to show the growing up of a boy
im sorry would you was your purpose in the bear to show the growing up of a small boy
how he grew up
not the growing up but to show a small boy in conflict with the adult world which he would have to cope with
that is he would have to be apart of it and be a good decent manor it would destroy him
the the small boys world is a is a world of innocence different from the adult world and his job is not in putting on inches and and pounds
it is simply in adapting himself morally and mentally to the adult world which he will have to be apart of and that tome is one of the most interesting phases of mans struggle with the human dilemma is how the child grows up to cope with the adult world
that tome is always interest in give written about that lots of times for that reason
it show the child grows up and takes the knocks and the broken head and the skinned knuckles which he must take to become a man without being destroyed to bring into the adult world something of the of the childs belief in some innate goodness or indecency or in courage in compassion
sir what do you find that makes people laugh
i would like to think it is joy in seeing that man really can survive his predicament
his predicament is represented by the horrible the outrageous things that might happen to him ye the survives the mi would like to think that is what makes people laugh
that it is not to seeyour your fellow man slip on a banana peel
its to see him slip on that banana peel and ye the survive sive ive heard you use the word fun several times and i wondered what is your idea of fun
well fun lets see if i can define that
in my own case it is to accomplish something which makes me feelgood which may make somebody else feelgood which wont hurt anybody
fun is to accomplish something which which i thought that perhaps i couldnt that i might not be brave enough or strong enough and then ido it and im successful
i suppose that everyone has a different notion of what fun means so i can tell you only what it means tome and what i when i say that to write for fun its to take mans dilemma the old familiar things in which there s nothing new and cant be anything new and by the light of my own experience and imagination and a great deal of hard work to make something which was a little different which wasn there yesterday
people write about the same stories because there s so few to write about
but to take one human beings in the old familiar dilemma and predicament and by the imagination and the hard work to show them in some new interesting tragic or comical instance of the struggle within the dilemma
that tome is fun
but then so is getting a horse over a fence that i wasnt too sure he could get over or that i would still be on him fun
is this fun for you right now
yes
because im still making something which wasn there yesterday dealing with with human beings which are all of you and me and mr mca leer in classrooms like this and then out of this i learn a little more about people and i would like to think that if some of you here want to write you may have learned a little more about how the writing gets done by someone who s been at it for thirty years
it doesnt have to be a very great new thing but something new might come out of it which is what i mean by the fun of being a writer that anybody likes to have a captive audience to talk to probably
you have a great knack for creating atmosphere
do you have togo about it consciously as poe did it or does it just sort of come naturally
well there s no writing comes naturally
its a great deal of concentration and hard work because ones standards are pretty high and i dont know there are probably times when the writers got to scrabble around and invent create some atmosphere
the other times when the situation he writes about the characters in it create the atmosphere
i think that every writer has sort of a storehouse of what he has read what he has seen and smelled and heard and remembered
after practice after a few years of writing he dont have togo through his files to get what he wants
he sort of reaches one hand behind him and pulls out just what he needs for that moment
be something that he remembered the way a bird in a tree looked or sounded the way an apple tree smelled the way dirt looked that was just ploughed and suddenly he s putting that down before he has had time to say now i need to write about how an apple tree smells
he s already done that
why do you think that there s so many good writers coming out of the south when there s so few people in the south that like to read literature
probably because the south has the leisure which is the dream of any artist
i think that the best thing a nation can do if it really wants peace to devote itself to things of the mind and human spirit is to pick out a goodrich nation declare war on them and let them and let themselves get whipped
i think after the north whipped us we had nothing to do but but to write paints owe became writers
the rest of the country was too busy supporting us
siri d like to aska more specific question if i may
in an odor of verbena i got the impression that bayard had been rather anticipating a violent death for his father for sometime and was braced for it in certain respects
ye the still had this thing which he was fighting all the way through the story this it as he calls it now it can begin again
exactly what was this feeling he had that he had to fight off before he could he anticipated his fathers violent death
he also knew that his father represented an obsolescence that he did not want to participate in that obsolescence
the the anticipation of his fathers death was not the the anguish and grief of the loss
it was the fact that he knew that when that happened this demand by all his tradition all his family his fathers new wife and his aunt would demand that he take a gun in his turn and go and shed blood to pay for shed blood
and that he was not going to do that
that s why he hated the moment when his father would meet that end that violent end which the boy knew his father would meet
that he would be a pariah to his tradition
that he was not going to take a gun and avenge his fathers blood
and that was the it that he hated
he didnt dread it
he was going to accept his fate but that was what he meant
that even the war had not settled that
to any rational man the lost war should have settled that
men should have said well we tried blood and that didnt work so lets quit it
but he knew that his father his fathers generation would not do that
and that he he believed that he would be the only one he knew that would would want to accept the future
he probably didnt realize that there were a lot of other young southerners that were willing to accept the future
he though the would be alone a pariah to his country his tradition his family his blood everything but i believe that his aunt jenny who was of his fathers generation thought it was all right
yes m because as i say women are adaptable
its men that cling to the old obsolete ways
women are adaptable even a woman a sold as aunt jenny
that she was knew that she would apostate to all the family tradition but she was on the side of the future like the boy was
sir do you think carson mc cull ers is going to be one of the leading writers in america today
that s a question that is difficult for somebody like me to answer because i dont judge writers
tome the book is the important thing
it dont matter who wrote it
and some people anyone is going to have bad days when what he writes is not good
the book is important who wrote it means nothing
i would say that she s done some some of the best work in our time but i wont say that she is the best or the worst writer or number three or number ten
as far as your writing is concerned what are your future plans for the next forty or fifty years
well i intend to keep on writing longer than just forty or fifty years
it ll take atleast a hundred to forme to get done all i want to write
and i will probably spend that time still trying to make something new which wasn there yesterday because writing is the one occupation which never bores you because its s at i ation is impossible
you never can quite do what you want to do
if what you want is money then someday you get all the money you want
you cant do anymore with it
but you never get done with the writing because you never quite do it as good as you think if you livelong enough you can do it tomorrow
that s what i mean by fun
its the one thing that you can do and never get bored with never get tired are you writing anything on your stay up in virginia
i think the writer is always cooking something up here
as he gets older he dont like to s it down and put it on paper
he d rather loa for talk to somebody or just s it and smoke
when he gets bored to a certain pitch he will face the job of putting it down on paper but he never stops inventing and weighing and discarding up here have you ever done any painting mr faulkner
not seriously
occasionally when something comes to hand or when they repainting barns and stables and things and ill get a smooth piece of plank and a knife or something to smear with and paint mules and people plowing and things like that but never serious
dogs in the woods
that sort of thing
horses siri believe you took a walking tour through europe for a number of days and im just wondering how much you got out of that in observing people and seeing things in europe
probably a great de although its impossible to say
i think the writer gets something from every experience
he will store that away and at need maybe tenor fifteen or thirty years later he will find that he needs something that he got then
he is omnivorous and amoral
he will take everything he sees with no judgment no discretion
since that is the material that he works from
but no writer can say i think just how much he got from what when siri d like to ask you a question about sherwood anderson s winesburg ohio
in winesburg anderson refers to almost every character that he refers to is tall that is alice hind man elizabeth willard and wash williams s wife
is there any reason for this using tall people is it some sort of symbolism or
it could be that that was his first book the first writing he did and probably more of of his own subconscious wishes appeared in that than would have appeared if he had got in the habit of writing and discharging that young but he was getting along towards forty years old when he wrote that book
he was a short man that probably all his boyhood had had wished he were bigger so he could fight better defend himself
it could be that that is the reason though it maybe that he simply admired tall people whatever the reason that some people admire tall people
but its just possible its because he himself was short
when he was sitting behind a table like this he looked like a big man but when he stood up he wasnt
and i think that he maybe would have liked to have been more imposing looking
at that time he didnt realize that probably its its not how higham an is
its what s in his face that makes him imposing looking thankyou mr faulkner
is peak for all of us
thankyou
background talking would it be better if i stood up like this mr
faulkner is david hog gan beck in a courtship an ancestor of boon hog gan beck in the bear
yes that would be boons grandfather probably
to yes that would be boons grandfather
in winesburg ohio sherwood anderson has a section in there on jesse bentley that doesnt seem connected with the rest of the book as much as the other chapters
that is none of the people in there knew george willard
there s been criticism of this
would you care to comment on that as it stands maybe your fourth section of the bear seems to bear a relation on the past to the present whereas is there much as much of a relationship in this section of winesburg ohio
im sure there was in mr anderson s concept of it
i think the writer looks on his work as an entity that it has got to please him by its completeness its wholeness
what seems extraneous to somebody else to him may seem completely necessary that without that eventhough it might have been been out of out of tune almost was necessary to the work as a whole an entity
and im sure that mr anderson felt that his book without that was not finished not complete
that it wasnt intact
malcolm cowley has written that not one of your characters exercises the faculty of conscious choice between good and evil that they seem to be haunted obsessed and driven or driven by some kind of destiny
do you think that s a valid statement
yes it is quite valid in in the sense that anyone who reads a book or story gives something to that something of himself to that book or that story
it takes that the the man that wrote it offers a concept
that is he offers his own opinionwhich is his own concept of a fundamental truth
someone else sees it sees the same fundamental truth but he adds something to it
if the critic is intelligent is sympathetic and is quite honest of course his criticism eventhough i might not agree with it is valid
and i think the writers not the one to say that its wrong simply because he doesnt agree with it
mr cowley maybe right
i dont think he is but im not the one to say that he s wrong just because we dont agree
but atleast he brought enough attention and sympathy to the book to have a sound or valid opinion of it which is certainly what the critic should do
not to write what the critics own clients expect to hear from him the next time he reviews a book but to give his concept of a piece of work a work of art
sir in as i lay dying do you conceive of dar las having more than one reason for burning the barn where his mothers body is being stored for the night
he probably did
dar l was mad
his reasons are would be completely valid reasons if you accept his premise
its like the man that sits on a plank full of tacks looks insane until you find out he think she s gandhi
dar l could have had our reasons and his own mad reasons for what he did
could have had any number of reasons the the sane reason might be to efface a but his own reasons we dont know what they might be because he was mad
some of the prose writers in this so called san francisco renaissance that s going on now feel that the novel form as a type is archaic and that it wont make any progress until they can get rid of the discipline imposed by simple grammar punctuation the language in general
i wonder how you d react to this idea of their s
i think the manner the method is not too important
the writer is simply trying to arrest in one dramatic moment an instant of mans struggle within the human dilemma
i think that he should use whatever method seems the best to him to do that
but i dont think that because he believes that his method is the best one that all other methods are bad
and i think that if anyone is going to waste his time trying to abolish the form of the novel then he s not going to get much good work done
to use whatever form is comes to hand that does his job
if its a moving picture camera use that
if he d rather use paint use that
if he d rather if he think she can do it better with sign language assuming that he can communicate with enough readers use that
i imagine that any form is going to change but i dont think that we will see the time when folks will get rid of grammar and punctuation
you use the term human dilemma
what do you describe as a human dilemma
the environment in which man frail and fragile with all his impulses his lusts greed s also his conscience whatever it is that makes him want to be better than he is and makes him even when he s responsible for it hate the condition in which the weak suffer and anyone is hungry which will always occur
that he would like to alter that
he has nt been able to s of a rye the doesnt quit trying
his dilemma is to arrange the world in which he lives in which he and where he came without any any choice into a condition in which he can get the most for his money you might say
his dilemma is his struggle with his own nature against his conscience
call that god or whatever you like
but whatever it is that makes man want to be better than he is and that he is afraid he maybe able to be
that he wants to be braver than he is afraid he might be he wants to be more honest than he s afraid he might be able to be
and he wants wants peace
he wants happiness what he calls happiness
and his dilemma is his struggle and striving to get that i in the sound and the fury mr faulkner jason comp son is one of your most memorable characters
tome he is one of the meanest orneriest people who i have ever conceived of
now if its not a personal question have you ever known anyone who was anywhere near as mean and as hateful as jason comp son
i hope i have nt
no writer worth his salt is going to believe that anybody can create better people than than he can more villainous or more saintly
and so i prefer to believe that there a in t anybody quite that bad because i would have lost the trick
i have found that a number of characters particularly in ab salom ab salom
and the sound and the fury have a great obsession with time and through their conception of time which often tends to define their characters
in other words an obsession with the pastor with the future or or placing time altogether out of the as the sum of their characters their their their own characters to their own detriment
and that dil sey perhaps and lena who approach time in a cyclical order and therefore have been able to make more order out of their lives
perhaps i have that in an inverted order but i wonder if you would if you would comment on that
well of course apart of of mans dilemma the individual dilemma is that man individual man is the victim of his past
actually there s there s no such thing as me probably that iam a conglomeration of a lot of us
probably a great deal of of mans behavior is from a pattern that was fixed long before he entered it
he inherited it that he can the lp doing some of the thing he does
he can the lp his attitude toward that that he he has
he he might be educated out of them
i think that the wise person i mean wise in the sense that dil sey was wise to do the best she could with what she had she would know by instinct that she must must abolish the past
that she must accept accept now and accept the moment in which now becomes will be
that she must be intact in now rather than to have one foot inside now and the rest of of the body in yesterday if she is to cope with environment
i dont know whether that makes any clearer what you asked or not does it
i have two questions about your short story lo
and the first one is what is the relation of the chief francis weddell to the indians which we see in a courtship or red leaves
simply another another clan
they were the same chickasaw people
that was just another clan
they may have been related by marriage even by blood but they had begun to take white names by that time
when as they became plantation owners and held us commissions but he was belonged to the same lot of people as is set ib be ha and his descendants well mr faulkner could you tell me when weddell takes his chickasaw s to washington takes his nephews and besieges the president whether this is just the action of a naive savage or whether he all the time is planning on getting the best of the president
i think that required a great deal of shrewdness that he was no longer in a position to take his spears and bows and arrows and his warriors and go there and get what he wanted so he used the whiteman s tactics i think that he was pretty shrewd about that that he just behaved in a naive and innocent way but he wasnt
that he had had abolished the past and had taught himself pretty fast to cope with now with environment
i have a couple of questions about the sound and the fury
the first one is quentin the daughter of dalton ames
do you remember that
yes she is
yes and the second one how do you think quentin would have turned out if jason wouldnt have been hounding her the all the time
would she have turned out well or
i dont know
that whole family was against her
i doubt if any child as insecure as she was to know suspect that she was insecure could have coped with that family of adults with nobody to defend her except the negro woman
probably she was doomed in any environment she would have found herself in i had the impression that she would have turned out fine if it had nt have been for jason
i cant say
i mim inclined to think that she was doomed that no matter what the environment would have been she was still doomed that s certainly poetically necessary in the book that she be
that was the reason for part of the reason for her uncles quentin s tragedy
i mean the poetic reason not the actual reason
in the sound and the fury you said that maury comp sons name was changed to benjamin
you mention it a number of times various places in the book what was the purpose of changing his name and why what was the importance of the change
maury was his mothers brother the only brother and they were a proud named family
this child was given that proud name and when he began to appear to bean idiot they didnt want him named maury so they changed his name
sir is there anything significance in the fact that at one point in the sound and the fury tp says that ben jy was not only deaf dumb but also deaf
nono ben jy wasnt really deaf but in tp
s concept if if you re you re deaf and dumb that means you cant talk and you you just dont have any sense
and he was saying you re deaf cause you you wont do what i tell you to do
he didnt mean that ben jy couldnt hear because he knew ben jy could
but that was tp
s exasperation with this creature who was bigger than he was and yet was more trouble than an infant
no that was just his name
vers hs name back in slavery times had probably been virgil and then his people couldnt spell it and it passed from son to son and finally wound up as vers h
it may have gone from virgil to verge and then it got to bever sh mr
faulkner this gentleman sir in as i lay dying which of ad dies children has the most love love for her and why
i would say that jewel did that jewel himself didnt know why he did he was a child of love
that he was illegitimate
and he and his mother were closer
he didnt know why
she did
and i imagine and also by his nature that he was not the child of of his shiftless father who loved nothing but his own comfort that jewel had inherited something of warmth from his father
sir were talking about names
just as we learn that eck s nope s is really name deck rum is there any longer name for iom ink and fl em
not hats like tp
s name the io
and mink mink was an orphan
he was raised by some kin people and he himself had never heard himself called anything but mink
someone asked him in a a book im at now what his name is
he says mink
he says is that all the name you ve got
he says that s all i know
and he s asked what did your mother call you
he said i dont know
she died
that he he doesnt know that s all he s heard cause he s raised passed from hand to hand anybody that would feed a childlike astray dog
would you say a few words about the significance of the easter service in the sound and the fury
only that at that point it seemed tome that was needed just as the the musician will put certain chords or themes or phrases into what he s doing
he himself may not know why
it seems obvious to him that something like that was needed and that s thebes the could do
it maybe counterpoint to the dreary scene in the house with that selfish woman the mother and this child who s taken out of the house to just so the woman his own mother wouldnt be bad with him is taken to church with these people going trying to follow the whiteman s concept of of the passion story for emphasis i suppose
was was there resentment among the colored people about ben jy going to church with dil sey
non on one whatever
sir at one point in that easter service dil sey mentions that she has seen the beginning and the end
what was it that referred to
was it religion or is it the family
its the family
she sees that there s doom on the family there there may have been one hope was that girl quentin
and quentin is gone
the doom which dil sey had been fighting against all her life had happened
and she saw the first of it and she did the best she could and now she s seen the end all that remains is an idiot boy that she takes to an easter service in a negro church that he cant even understand
sir in as i lay dying is there any significance significance significance in the fact that var daman catches the fish at the beginning and keeps comparing the death of it to that of his mother rather than it being some other animal perhaps
yes
that s a question that s a little little hard forme to answer because anything in the book has some need more than significance
there was a need it seemed tome that that should be there
the connection i felt of the transference that the little boy made between the dead fish and the blood and his dead mother was an instance of a childs rationalizing thinking
but there were no symbolism intended there
noi dont
i dont know who did that
of course the the symbolism was simply the powers of of darkness and of light wrestling struggling
i dont know whose idea that jacket was or who did it
sir the title of the sound and the fury is taken from macbeth s speech isnt it
yes yes
there must have be atleast a dozen books named from that one speech
it seems that one of the tragedies of quentin comp son that was the greatest is the inability to view himself at all in time
he has the obsession to begin with and then confused and then he battles time altogether mechanical and natural time he destroys his clock and he puts himself in the future and looks back at himself
he s totally confused and yet totally obsessed with time trying to put it in some rational understanding for himself and he fails and i kind of wonder if his failure after an attempted intellectual approach and dil sey s success at more of an emotional approach which seemed to indicate a collective attempt at trying to relate to time to live with time from a natural perspective cannot be reached in an intellectual rational manner but more or less comes from an emotional or instinctive comprehension
remember quentin was not trying to put time into perspective
he was trying to escape from time into the past
he was trying to escape back into a time when all this which i hate was not
he failed and so he committed suicide there was only one more step left to him
he couldnt be alive and escape back before when his sister was pure
and so he had to commit suicide
that was all that remained for him
dil sey accepted the past and she didnt waste herself trying to discard it or getaway from it
she simply accepted it and said all right
so it is
lets goon
lets go forward
that time was in its perspective i think for the both of them but but one of them hated now and wanted to return to was which you cant do because what was is
there s actually no such thing as was
as we said any man is the victim of not only victim but the sum of his past
he never escapes from it quentin wanted to escape back into it
how real are the these amorous exploits of gerald bland in the sound and the fury is is he just bragging trying to live up to his mothers dramatic conception of him or does he really
i suspect that most of them are lies that he would be like any fiction e er nothing that happened would be quite as good as what he could imagine
so the ones that actually happened would be dull to him
the one she told about were probably all lies did quentin before actually have a conversation with his father about sleeping with his sister
or was that part of his
he never did
he said if i were brave i would i might say this to my father whether it was a lie or not
or or if i were if i would say this to my father maybe he could answer me back the magic word which would relieve me of this anguish and agony which i live with
no they were imaginary
he just said suppose i say this to my father would it help me
i live with
no they were imaginary
he just said suppose i say this to my father would it help me
would it clarify
would i see clearer what it is that i anguish over
yes yes
but in caddy s opinion he was such a weakling that even if they had been no kin she would never had chosen him for her sweetheart
she would have chosen one like the ex soldiers he did but never anybody like quentin
no
no caddy seemed a nice name for her and i had to think of something to justify it
mr faulkner you said that your vision of caddy was one of the things that started you on the novel
what qualities other than bravery seem to you to make her such a person that you could feel that strongly about
she was independent herself
she was confident
she was compassionate enough to take care of the idiot child
that was no burden to her if her mother never had to say caddy i want you to look after benjamin this afternoon
because she loved him
she would have done that anyway
and she was convinced that she could do the best for him
if what she couldnt do dil sey would tend to with that benjamin would be all right with her
she could look after him
and that she could take care of all of them
if there was something that would be pleasant for them to do she would run the affair
im curious about jason that negro boy tells him to keep his hands out of his pockets because he s falling on his face all the time he stumbles
why was he fat and clumsy when he was younger
probably that was a mannerism keeping his hands in his pocket
tome that presaged his future something of greediness and grasping selfishness
that he may have kept his hands in his pocket to guard whatever colored rock that he had found that was for him represented the million dollars he would like to have someday
in the thumbnail sketch you describe describe luster as being a man of fourteen capable of taking care of an idiot and entertaining him at the sametime
why why do you consider luster a man
because he could do a mans job
at this time the idiot was twice his size was actually dangerous
the idiot by that time was a man and yet luster at fourteen could cajole him when necessary could trick him could even apply enough physical force when necessary to keep him in hand
its like the lion tamer is a man
it means simply that he s big enough for his job
that s what luster i meant by that
in luster s terminology a man is anyone who is big enough to do what he has to do
sir in part two of the sound and the fury the little italian girl following quentin is this to represent
im sorry
i dont remember her
ill have to get that book and look at it i cant remember her
maybe mr
gwynn could prompt me a little there
is that in cambridge yes sir or outside of cambridge well i mean when he is at harvard
well that s probably what it was
no symbolism
it was he had a a tenderness an admiration for for women for girls and also a sublimation of the concept of virginity after his tragic situation with his sister
it maybe that s what it was does quentin commit suicide by jumping in the river or
yes by drowning
yes
you say that the something s you dont know exactly why you put them in would you say that the so called psychological critics could now tell you why you put them into your books
a good psychologist certainly could or he would be a bad psychologist if he couldnt i think that one reads a book from the same jumping off place that one writes a book that one reads a book from his own background of of observation imagination and experience too that noone man can put into a book what a dozen men can can read into it but dont you think artistic control keeps the psychologist from analyzing the writing no mi dont think so
maybe i dont understand what you mean by artistic control well dont you have to put the things in a certain order object if y them and make them just the opposite from what a psychologist wants them
i wouldnt think so
the writer is writing from his own observation imagination experience and out of the same background which the psychologist operates from
that is from the call it christianity the caucasian race
the same background of education of environment which is the sametime period in time and they would have some of the identical ideas which came from that near to identical backgrounds which are identical in the period of time in the culture of the country of the speech of the literature
sir in as i lay dying what was the significance of dar ls lying in front of his mothers coffin after it was saved from the fire
dar l was mad
he did things which it seemed tome he he had to door he insisted on doing
his reasons i could could try to rationalize to suit myself or even if i couldnt rationalize his reasons to please mei had to accept the acts because dar l insisted on doing that
i mean that any character that you write takes charge of his own behavior
you cant make him do things once he comes alive and stands up and casts his own shadow
dar l did things which i mim sure were for his own mad reasons quite logical
i couldnt always understand why he did things but he did insist on doing things and when we would would quarrel about i the always won because at that time he was alive
he was under his own power
you mentioned that your characters are struggling to cope with the dilemma of life
are any of them actually successful in reaching a point where life is not does not present itself as a dilemma
well they reach a point where life is no longer a a nun cope able dilemma
there is one a sewing machine agent called ratliff that handled living pretty well
there are others that handled it pretty well
i think dil sey did though her s was tragic
but it never did it might have dented her head a little but it never beat her to her knees
ratliff got along quite well with it because he realized recognized his own limitations and the fact that the dilemma although it was insoluble was not un cope able with
i think fl ems nope she coped with it pretty well
where did you find all your information on the chickasaw indians
are there records
yes m
there there are records there but in ever did do much research
i would i probably got my information about indians a sive got it about most of the other things i know from listening to people and adding a little imagination to it
i suspect that no chickasaw would recognize my chickasaw s but people that do know more about mississippi s history dont quarrel too much with my picture of chickasaw indians
and also i have known some of their descendants
they have mixed with white people or with negroes are still in my country and i dont think that people are all that different no matter what color they are that people are different more because of the pressure of their environment than because of their blood
accept and endure throughout your work meaning of that
that probably refers to man getting along within the human predicament
that you ve got to accept it because the only other choice is to cut your throat
if you cope with it within your capacity to give when its stronger than you then you endure
and the only alternative to enduring is also to cease
and man is here through no choice of his own
he has as far as he know she s not going anywhere else and if he does anything with what time he knows who he is it will have to be while he is here and he had better i think teach himself to accept the predicament and to endure in it and still get as much pleasure as he can without doing harm to anyone
or if he s benton doing good to people that swell enough
let him uplift man
but in order to accomplish anything to be a writer to be a doctor to do anything well to even to have fun you ve got to accept the predicament and endure in it
i wonder how did you happen to have come up with the title the sound and the fury from macbeth and i thought that perhaps it came from the speech i mean the speech that it came from all our yesterdays of macbeth himself and i wondered if there was any merit in the analogy of the character macbeth who having created his own chaos inflicts it on life and the universe with the same actions of quentin comp son
no it came simply from the words themselves the ringing sound of the phrase a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury
it had nothing to do with with macbeth s character
it was simply from the phrase
the part of ben jy is the tale told by an idiot i would assume
yes yes the book began as a short story
benjamin of course was a deliberate choice from the biblical benjamin
sorry i was wondering in your indian stories again lo
and a courtship and in a justice except for the framework your stories these stories are very humorous but in red leaves while there is a good deal of wry humor that story seems to be much more serious and i wondered if you dc are to comment
only in primitive people si mean by primitive peoples a small group which are obsolete inside another culture the distance between what is humor and what is tragic is never very great that it it maybe funny now but you better watch out
that was simply that the same conditions the same ingredients with just a little more or little less fire under it might make something completely different
that the implacable pursuit of that poor negro was funny to anybody but him and that not and also it was not funny to the indians that had to stop sitting down to getup and walk him down to catch him
but the picture of of those lazy people that didnt want to do that having to catch that negro tome was funny
but the result the purpose of it was anything but funny
the indians that went to call on president jackson was funny but it wasnt funny to the indians and certainly wasnt very funny to president jackson
i was wondering what you call inheritance but in the moment that you state
i think what i intend to say is mans immediate behavior is the result of the pressure of his environment
the the method in which he behaves of course is heredity
you think it is more or less
im sorry
if it does not change very much
i think that heredity if the word means anything must be a constant factor
that would not change
it would alter
it would evolve
mans behavior which at one moment is this and in under another situation is that is because of the pressure of the immediate environment
but irregardless of his blood his heritage circumstance will compel him to make choices
he will make the choice according to the pressure of the environment
ma am
the future to you you feel is done
for that moment you can more or less predict from that moment their behavior
maybe we mean different things by by environment
when i use that term i mean the immediate conditions of of of a moment the environment that has has shaped a childs character from the time it was born until its ten years old has become apart of heritage by that time
i use environment as the immediate moment
that is environment tome now is us in this room does this mean that young bayard sartori s for example inherited death by violence
death by violence was apart of his past
it was a apart of the creed of his family
he inherited that creed
he didnt have to function according to it
which he didn the refused to do that
because he was saying trying to repudiate the past not to cling to it
his tradition was that death by violence came sooner or later if you stuck to the creed of an eye for an eye blood for blood and the emptiness of that sort of pride
that was his inheritance but his behavior was because of his environment which had which was the result of a lost war in which people should have had enough of blood for blood and an eye for an eye
that that solved nothing
sir do you recall a short story you wrote called delta autumn
i wonder what would be the comment off lem s nope s if such a story were told to him as being true
why i suppose he would he wouldnt be too interested in it because there would be no percentage in going to the woods for two weeks just to shoot deer
he would be familiar with it
it would be a a foolish way to spend two weeks
was that what you meant
different stories
is this is the story where the going off to arizona with this negro woman isnt that part of the story of delta autumn
delta autumn was a camp of deer hunters in which a young woman an egress the discarded mistress of of one of the white hunters came to the camp to see him that was the part of the story that i was referring to that what fl ems nope s comment would be on that sort of thing happening within his environment
well that was his environment
he lived there too
he just didnt go deer hunting
he probably had had children by a negro woman himself
nono only the faulkner laughing no only only the comp son family only that comp son family
that they had refused to accept now and tomorrow
and there s no place for the minnow because they wouldnt accept it or maybe that s backward if there had been a place for them they wouldnt have been comp sons
not hats what dil sey meant by the first and the last
it was the comp sons that family
that was quentin s thought
its not mississippian s norfolk s in jefferson but but us comp sons are doomed that we have had it
oh thankyou all
today wear every fortunate to have as our special guest mr william faulkner of oxford mississippi the celebrated justly celebrated southern writer of fiction and winner of the nobelprize for literature in our panel is somewhat larger than usual today as several of the students from my english class have joined us
in addition to mr robert kellogg of the department of english one of our regular panel members we have with us also today mr houk mrs massey miss winslow miss taylor miss marston mr b agley mr nes bit mr miller mr carlson and miss frame of the class in the history of the english language who are here to ask mr faulkner some questions about his use of dialect and other questions concerning language in his fiction writing
and i suppose without further a do we might as well start on the questions
mr houk will you leadoff with the first question please
that s correct
it was translated back to doom not by him but by his associates trying to pronounce his french name given to him by the french adventurer who called himself the chevalier soeur blonde de vitry that he met in new orleans
that was simply an anglicization of the french del homme
noi would certainly like to think id invented that
id like to ask you about your use of a in tin the dialogue of your characters
in particular in as i lay dying
when anse bund ren is talking to vernon tull he says iain tasking it of you he says i can always do it forme and mine
iain tasking you to risk your mule
it a in t your dead iam not blaming you
now why do you have the switch between from a in t to am not
am not is more positive so you use the am not when you are definite yes to be very positive yes
otherwise they would have said a in t
in the portable faulkner the editor says incidentally the title of the novel has nothing to do with august sunlight it refer stolen a grove and her baby
in the mississippi backwoods it is sometimes said of a pregnant woman but more often of am are or cow that she will be light in august or september
is this how you meant it to be the title
no in ever heard of that
it refers to a texture of the light in august in my country in a spell of two or three cool days we call blackberry winter
its the light
i had never heard that business of after the cow drops the calf she slight in august and that you dont know that expression at all
noi haven the ard it in georgia either i suppose people have spoken to you of it since then
yes
in connection with this class in particular we ve been very interested in reading about names in america about personal and geographical names
i wonder to what extent the names that you use parallel those that have actually occurred in your lifetime or in any history that you may have learned
i think any writer is very careful always not to use actual names if he can help it because a great deal of his time would betaken up explaining to the actual owner of that name that he didnt refer to him was not impugning his character nor his past nor his parentage originally in the spotted horses story were nt you going to call the sewing machine salesman surat t and then you met somebody by that name so you changed the name to ratliff didnt you
yes that s right
does the speech of sartori s in the story ad astra have any special dialect qualities
is it a southern speech or is it just the speech of an average educated american
it would be the speech of a limited young man who had no particular education
it was a speech he had heard from his associates back on his mississippi plantation colored just a little by what he had listened to serving with english troops probably
ek s nope s uses the archaic word lief in id just as lief let them stay out there
is this word still common in mississippi
oh yes there are any number of words derived from lowland scottish in mississippi country people stalk
they say to ret up a room
that leif it maybe just my own in experience but i have nt come across that in georgia
i wonder it maybe a difference between the speech of georgia popular speech folk speech in georgia and in mississippi
i remember being struck by that too because i wasnt familiar with it in georgia speech
to what degree do you consider dialect in speech important in characterization
i think you cant draw a character simply by putting dialect into his mouth
it is important as apart of the picture of the man an indigenous picture of the individual
in that sense its important that is a man will speak according to his nature his degree and his geography here san example that might have a bearing on that
in the story barn burning the little boys arty s nope s uses the forms the grammatical forms our n and his n
what do these tell the reader about the speaker would you say
that he came from an uneducated class of white people those terms are in use in the southern mountains more than in the lowlands i think in the south more than in the coastal plains of the south is there any implication that these people are from mountain extraction or anything of that sort
yes they re people whose dialect has not been colored at all by the talk of of negroes
they are mountain people where there are not many negroes
their speech is harsher
the r is more definite than the r in the white child that has lived with negroes yes
of course that san old controversy whether the negroes learned their speech from the white people or whether the white people were influenced by the negroes
i guess wed better not get into that its too complicated a question
again from sartori sold man falls is a strong dialect characterization
how did you arrive a this speech and what level of society is he intended to represent
he represents the older class of southerner
he was not quite illiterate in his time as the as as nope s would be in his
he had a close association with people that were literate
but he too belongs to the class whose ancestors owned no slaves
i was wondering from your short story that evening sun theresa section when jason talks with nancy he says im quoting now i didnt have fun jason said
you hurt me
you put smoke in my eyes
yawl made me come
and i wonder are you using yawl there as a directed at nancy
in other words is he is that singular
nono never you ve never used yawl in the singular
never singular have you ever heard it used in the singular
no in ever have either
ill bear you out on that
not by a southerne rive heard northerners use it in the singular
theresa traditional character in literature soph on is ba who was the daughter of has drub a land the subject of many tragedies
she is not known too much today i dont think but your character from the short story was from go down moses i believe miss soph on si bai believe is the way you pronounce her name is that is the change of that s from soph on is ba to soph on sib a a change just of the s not of the accent is that your is that intentional
intentional in this sense to imply that the people of of her her class and her time were were involved with with books with culture but they were careless with it too and they would mispronounce the names they would take classical names and give to the negro slaves and would probably mispronounce them so that after the negro had passed it on to his children it became something else but at one time it came out of the classics that someone who had read the latin or the greek had seen it we ve sort of talked around this
i was wondering do you have any key by which you goto make a distinction between the dialogue of your various the various levels of your characters such as between the comp sons the s nope s the negroes and the indians and so forth
is there anything that you use as a distinction between these two between all of these
no of course not deliberately
its a a concept that the comp son would speak a little differently from as nope s or from an intermediate between comp son and s nope s
that s a matter of the earth at these people when a writer gets the character properly on his feet the character takes charge of things
the character says this is what im going to say you put it down
thankyou very much mr faulkner
our time will not permit further questioning at this session but be with us again next week when again our writer in residence mr william faulkner of oxford mississippi will be with the members of the english class in order to answer questions concerning his use of dialect and of language in general in his fiction
with us on the panel today have been mr robert kellogg of the department of english and various and sundry members of the english class whose names i have nt time to mention at this time
this is edward stevenson with the department of english asking you to be again with us at the sametime next week for another session on this same subject were very happy to bring you again today our writer in residence at the university mr william faulkner of oxford mississippi who has consented to speak to the members of the english class in the history of the english language concerning matters involving his use of dialect or any feature of his use of language in his fiction
our panel is therefore somewhat larger than usual
besides myself and mr kellogg of the department of english we have mr houk mrs massey miss winslow miss taylor miss marston mr b agley mr nes bit mr miller mr carlson and miss frame of the english class
and now without further a do miss winslow will you please leadoff with the first question
i doubt if there can be any rule about that
i think that anything the shorter its said the better
i think that stories title themselves quite often
yes in that anything the shorter its said the better it is
long is a good long title or wash this might sound like atypical question from a proud virginian but how did you arrive at at arrive at the name jefferson for the town
it old that in a book called requiem for an unit was the mail carrier in or it was who brought the mail into what was then an indian trading post had had been a tenant on mr jeffersons place one of mr jeffersons places here in albemarle county
its an involved long story but it explain show they named the town jefferson well that s interesting
in ever knew that it really was connected with thomas jefferson
very good
in your writing of dialogues do you present the words of your characters as they would have spoken them
or do you just use a touch of dialect to color the character
i think best to use as little dialect as possible because it confuses people who are not familiar with it
that nobody should let the character speak completely in his own vernacular its best indicated by a few simple sparse but recognizable touches
one has to take liberties to that extent
i think that some of the things that huck finn recorded he couldnt have done a this age
that s the liberties which the writer must take in order to make his story clear and interesting
yes that his point of view is still that of his age eventhough his diction may not be sir would you make any distinction between what say a southern mountain character would say in and what he would say in or is it just all what you heard when you were in
i think that his vernacular his dialect wouldnt alter so much as his vocabulary might increase a little because of radio and and books and newspapers which he can get or he cant escape from getting in which he couldnt get in or let me put in a sort of a variation on that question
do you try to make any distinction between what you conceive today to be the speech say of the s and maybe the s
no more than we just stated the vocabulary might change but the diction wouldnt
in listening to several of your talks i find it sort of curious and rather remarkable that often you use what is generally considered to be bad grammar for instance he don taint
do you have a conscious intent in talking in this manner
no is it a certainly i have no question that you know what good grammar is
is it just are collection in your mind of the speech in mississippi at the
probably old muscular habits in speech if you will agree that speech can have old muscular habits just like the armor the hand can
tome that s not really too important that a little bad grammar dont hurt anything that s really more old fashioned i think than anything else
probably yes you find you find for instance things like he dont in the letters of lord byron ive noticed sir do you think that the dialect or speech of the southern negro is a deterrent to his progress
noi shouldnt think that anyone s speech should be a deterrent to his progress if he just dont use too much of it
i think a lot of well put
i think a lot of people talk too much
the wife in the fire and the hear than educated negro woman seems indirect contrast to oldman falls in sartori s
this is a transcription of her speech where are you going this time of night
messing around up yonder in the bottom all last night getting back home just in time to hitch up and get to the field a good hour after sunup
whereas oldman falls is c un nel was sett in thar in a cheer his sock feet propped on th epoch rail in smokin thi shyer very pipe
since the copyright date on sartori s is and the copyright date on go down moses from which the fire and the heart his taken is much later does this difference in true in the representation of dialect indicate a definite trend on your part or is this merely a social difference
i would say its a social difference that the negro woman maybe had a little more to say to tell the story which gets back to what we just spoke of also she had been associated with a better class of white a more literate cultured class of white people for more of her life than oldman falls had
it maybe the negro woman had a little more chance to talk than oldman falls had
there has appeared in american speech magazine some articles on the southern dialect and it points out certain peculiarities about the southern dialect
now these articles were written by men who in the mississippi and louisiana area
the inconsistency seems to appear in the fact that some of these examples that they show are not consistent with examples shown in the georgia dialect or perhaps in in the carolinas
my question is this do you think that there could possibly be a split in the southern dialect between the carolinas and georgia and perhaps draw a rough line down alabama and have a different dialect on your side sort of two sub dialects maybe an eastern and a western division of the southern dialect that s right
im not too certain of that
ido know the dialect in some parts of mississippi and louisiana has been colored a little by french and spanish influence
i think that the dialect would be consistent more by contour lines as mr stevenson spoke of the people of the lowlands speak differently from the people in the hills so the people in the north alabama hills and east tennessee hills and georgia hills would speak a dialect
the people in the flatlands of georgia the flatlands of alabama and mississippi would speak a dialect which would be almost identical
the people along the coast would speak a dialect colored just a little by the influence of spanish and french and creole in connection with this sir wash jones uses speech characterized by the following air for are y it for yet and hit for it and various others of course
although we know from our studies in our class that this is generally common southern speech many of your characters on somewhat the same social plane as wash jones do not use this type of speech
in the genealogy at the rear of the ab salom modern library ab salom ab salom wash jones is said to its said that the date and location of his birth is unknown
could we assume possibly that he comes from from somewhere in tennessee if he uses this speech
from a hill country yeshe res a question id like to get in before our time runs out about a linguistic device that writers often use more commonly seen in poets perhaps than in prose fiction in poetry rather than in prose fiction i refer to the use of alliteration
and let me read you a sentence from barn burning and note the alliteration on the s sounds
his two hulking sisters this is the little boys point of view his two hulking sisters in their sunday dresses and his mother and her sister in calico and sunbonnets were already in it sitting on and among the sorry residue of the dozen and more moving s which even the boy could remember
was that a conscious use of alliteration or is it just happenstance
happenstance sure enough do you ever use alliteration consciously
noi dont have time i mean by that the writer is too busy getting the story down before he forgets it to bother too much about his grammar or his style or the tricks he might use but in the process of revision might nt you scratch out sometimes and substitute something which you think would sound a little better
a revise r would but nobody is going to revise if he can help it
that is nobody revises for fun
if its all right he lets it go
the publisher can correct the grammar if he thinks its needed well i see our time has run out
i want to thank mr faulkner very much that there was a possibility of meeting with you we thought it might bean opportunity for us to get together and talk about some of these things
that s good
you ll find a complete amateur in me
i dont know whether you can find anything in me that would interest the people in your profession well i think that that we ve decided maybe were the amateurs in a great many respects
some of your people that you select of course they re unusual people in away
do you select them as unusual
ori guess theresa type that seems to appeal to you
i doubt if i know whether is elect these people or they select me
i think that the writer is trying to take some comic or tragic moment of man in his struggle inside the human condition and tell it in some form which other people would find comic or tragic i as far as i know iam dealing simply with people in the condition that i have seen people that these people tome seem quite sane and quite normal even ones that are mad seem tome quite sane people
probably that s because the writer has already accepted the premise if the man believe she s mahatma gandhi so when he lies on aboard full of tacks he s a rational creature by mad do you mean by society s
the the character in the book as i lay dying dar lone of the sons was mad as society would call him mad
tome he wasnt wasnt mad
or that is i didnt set out to say now one of these brothers will have to be mad so i will invent a good mad one according to what ido know of the rules of insanity
i was just writing about what was tome a pitiable tragic human being and you have nt had much experience in state hospitals or anything
none whatever
none whatever
i think you dont need togo to state hospitals to find people that society calls mad
there certainly seems to be a common denominator of interest
so often the psychiatrist is interested in much of the same area of human function that comes out in so called madness or in the different individuals who are crazed and things
it seems tome a very definite similarity in atleast perception interest on the part of the novelist and the psychiatrist perhaps in this vein
i should agree with you
could you say a few words about what you might consider as irrational human behavior
noi couldnt
ive never tried to setup what might be a pattern forme to measure irrational human behavior
tome all human behavior is unpredictable and considering mans frailty the in the ramshackle universe he functions in its its all irrational
it couldnt be very rational because his universe is not a very rational one it seems tome
i think that probably no writer would set himself up to judge
if he d begun to judge the people he writes about his all the whatever the gods are that lets him do something which is his cup of tea he likes might withdraw the gift
if he begins to preach or or proselytize or or pass judgment that the fire might go out
also i think the writer is not really interested in in bettering mans condition
he really doesnt care a damn about mans condition
he is interested in allman s behavior with no judgment whatever
that its its motion
its life
the only alternative is nothingness death
and so to the writer anything man does is fine because its motion
if he were not doing that he would be nothing
he dbe dead
maybe the writer has no concept of morality at all only an integrity to hold always to what he believes to be the facts and truth of human behavior not moral standards at all
but that man in his books does what man will do not what man should do but what he will do maybe what he can the lp but do is the writers motivation then simply just a portrayal of that which most people see but perhaps dont take in
did you say the writer
noi think that his aim is maybe more specific
he simply wants to make something which wasn there yesterday there s not much that he can do
he can take only the old struggles of man within the human predicament and by showing it slightly awry or with some faint new light from an individual perception make something which was a little different from what was here before
that is what what the writer ahead of him did
there s nothing new he can write about
i think that s maybe the writers denial of of mortality of death that he s going to write on the wall k il roy was here
theoretically the psychiatrist also does not make judgments
he essentially takes man as he is and life as it is and tries to understand him and yet we think that we would be kidding ourselves if we do nevertheless look at these things from our own perspective and certainly when when the idea comes in of trying to do anything about it which the writer doesnt do and which we do actually do attempt to do as we attempt to better the situation you ve got to think in terms of bettering it to what aim or what goal and those are essentially the goals that we ourselves will hold at the at the present time or at any given time
can a writer really avoid personal judgment or value systems or
he can as long as he is a writer
i think that a writer is a perfect case of split personality that he is one thing while he is a writer and he is something else while he s a a denizen of of the world
it maybe that that s not that he cant be rid of that split that maybe he has a hope that what he does may improve man in the sense that it will give to man some instance of of mans fine record being fragile and frail and and not his own boss by any manner of means yet out of that he has managed somehow to endure to have accomplished a few things which have lasted
maybe in that sense the writer has got to work formans betterment even if he is not deliberately trying to
i think that in away the psychiatrist is doing that too
that i imagine a psychiatrist in with one human being could learn about all he would need to know about what makes man do what he does and he would stop then and since he will devote his life to i the must have some thought that somehow he will improve in the end mans condition what is your idea of what makes man do what he does
i think that man is trying to do what he does because he wants to that he himself does not always know why he wants to but it it makes him feelgood
it makes his glands function right
people do foolhardy reckless dangerous things because it makes the glands flow good makes them feelgood
i think that man is not a gambler just to get a lot of money that he gets some pleasure
his system works good when he is engaged in taking chance for money or using his skill to gain money
the money is just a symbol of it
i think he would be a gambler if he were had to gamble for matches
i would say that man does what he does because he wants to
no siri dont
only what i have learned about it from listening to people that do know
what little of psychology i know the characters i have invented and playing poker have taught me but freud i mim not familiar with you apparently believe in human extrasensory perception though dont you
yes i probably depend almost completely on it
i dont have a trained mind
ive got to depend on extrasensory perception would you tellus something perhaps about your acquaintance ship with some of the people that have been the prototypes for the characters in your writing
im just wondering how you got to know them so well to have been able to pick their thoughts
i think this is related to dr wilsons idea about the subconscious that would be through a an unflagging curiosity about people interest in what people are doing how they do it and what they say
not with any desire to study people or to store up material to work from but out of simple curiosity i reckon
though it it maybe that no man could be that disinterested in the material he works from
maybe that any writers something like a pack rat
he gathers up every scrap he sees on the chance that someday he may need it and sure enough there it is
the characters i think are composite of experience observation and imagination but nobody could say just how much of which goes into it
im convinced though that no writers going to be satisfied just to write use people as he saw them because he s convinced that he can do a better job of creating credible people than the lord can
he can always improve on and he s also probably a congenital liar that s why they call it fiction i suppose he probably couldnt tell the truth on any subject do you actually make notes of people who arouse your curiosity
no sir
never did any research never made any notes
i have a lot of faith in my memory
if i cant remember it it wasnt worth keeping anyway probably
as i understand it correct me when you said that you thought the psychiatrist took a man and was capable of knowing him well enough or understanding him well enough he would know about the nature of man more as as much as that you would otherwise for example studying people as a group or as a culture
i would assume so
but then i dont know
im ignorant
as is a yi have no training in psychology psychiatry
i would assume that psychiatrists could learn as much about man from one man as a surgeon could about man from one cadaver
that s probably wrong but that s my assumption how much influence in for example in your portrayal and creation of people how much influence does does a given culture have in determining this person that you make or write about
it d have a great deal of influence but but mostly on the surface
it would influence his idioms his surface actions his manners
but i would say if you went deep enough he would look a good deal like the same individual of his age and physical condition in some african culture you dont deliberately use symbolism do you
i suspect the writers too busy to deliberately use anything even good grammar that he is simply trying to get something down and he hashes completely immoral
he will rob and steal from any source he finds just like the pack rat against the daywhen maybe hell need it
and writing out of a culture which which has certain symbols in time he will reproduce those symbols without any deliberation
that s not himself not his own erudition
it was simply the culture which he which was the environment he grew up in and maybe something of its residue which produced it
but i think any writers too busy dealing with people and and people are incredible and in motion
all the writer can do once the characters come to life is to run at topspeed behind them and try to put down everything they do and say before they get out of sight out of hearing that he has nt got time to use symbols deliberately most of your characters are certainly highly individualized human beings
do you have any particular ideas on the so called trend toward conformity or loss of individual iz ation in our current society
yes
i have very definite ideas about that and if i ever become a preacher it will be to preach against man individual man relinquishing into groups any group
i mim against belonging to anything of course when when i was young i belonged to young peoples fraternities and things like that but now i dont want to belong to anything except the human race why is that
i think that there s too much pressure to make people conform and i think that one man maybe first rate but if you get one man and two second rate men together then he s not going to be first rate any longer because the the voice of that majority will be a second rate voice
the behavior of that majority will be second rate
and i think that a second rate man who stays himself atleast wont be third rate
but no second rate man is going to become first rate just by joining one or two more first rate people could you go further and say how you rate people like that for instance second rate
well sir that would be a little difficult and maybe a little trite
i would say that a first rate man is one is a man that did thebes the could with what talents he had to make something which wasn there yesterday and also to that never hurt an inferior never harmed the weak practiced honesty and courtesy and tried to be as brave as he wanted to be whether he always was that brave or not
i think that a man that held to those tenets wouldnt get very far if he were involved in a group of people that had relinquished their individual i ties to someone voice which would could control their behavior
do you feel like that man is you might say by nature first rate or second rate influences or circumstances lead to his being what he is
by nature being one being other in other words man by nature has to pull himself up or to first rate being a first rate person orman by nature would be a first rate person and some are pulled down to being second rate people
i would say that he would have to pull himself up to be what i have premised as a first rate human being that the child is not born a first rate human being in that sense because the child is still a savage until it well until a little boy is not civilized until he about thirteen or fourteen when he falls in love with his teachers he teaches him to wash his face behave like a member of the human race
i dont believe that all people are are born equal if that s what you mean that they are all people are not born second rate or tenth rate that some people maybe incapable of ever becoming first rate
but that would be from possibly yes it would have to be heredity because environment could be changed and if all if there was only environment that held people second rate that could be changed but some people are born incapable of being first rate this freedom that you insist on interests meagre at deal
it seems tome that that s where much of psychiatry goes astray is in loss of of freedom to think and act and so fort has we would if we were totally free or as you say relinquish our individuality
aside from joining things though do you find find that its a constant path of maintaining freedom or is it something that comes natural to you in other words are you a natural rebel against convention or conformity
i dont know whether i believe there s such things as natural rebel
i think that mans impulse that man really doesnt want to be free that he is willing to relinquish his freedom to anyone that will give him bread and circuses that it takes a certain amount of education or precept by someone older and wiser to make a young man value freedom enough to struggle for it
its very easy for him to submit to the constant pressure from the people who have got to sell him something in order to keep an economy of waste in motion like ours
to be free he san anachronism
he s against he s a fly in their ointment
and whether he had an impulse to be free that impulse will not be enough in a young man against all the concerted organized pressure to make him relinquish freedom into the hands of whoever runs the finance company that collects on his automobile or or compels him to be married in order to sell another dish washing machine to somebody how long do you think that if we know an individuals experiences i mean which is very difficult to do but if we just say that ideally we know all these experiences that a person has had dont you think that we can predict his behavior
i would think if anybody could predict his behavior it would be the psychologist the psychiatrist i mean dont you think that a person what he does is based on the way he has been raised the experiences he has had in the past are they formative of his conduct of what he does or what he says
i was to an extent and and also to an extent what he does at the moment is his environment is responsible for it that he would have impulses which which his heredity may have taught him to keep down but his environment may have released him from the prohibition
that if you change his environment he he might would behave differently
it wouldnt alter what he wanted to do but probably any morality is simply a system of of of enabling a man to say dont to himself with this loss of freedom conformity materialism and so forth how optimistic or pessimistic do you feel about our current culture as we see it today
well pessimism is i wouldnt dont like to accept that term because i have a great belief in man
he has survived the dinosaur and iam convinced he will survive his atom bombs
iam convinced that the last sound on earth will be two people building an airship arguing about where they re going next i have a great faith in man more specifically in terms of our west so called western culture
its an unpleasant one
its a a nuisance to have to live through but the only alternative is to get out if it and you cant it wont last anymore than the other cultures
and this one as soon as we have used up the last of the natural resources we will have another one
this is we are living in an economy of waste to buy a new one next year
we clutter the earth up with the automobiles and washing machines we turned in in order to buy a new one and that may create jobs and maybe the scientists will invent some way to vaporize all these things and that ll be something for general motors
they could have a gas that would vaporize every car in the street and leave us sitting there with with the steering wheel in your hand nothing behind you start all over again
its that or finally choke the earth up and build a roof over it
start over you rewriting a novel now i guess
well i just said said that the writer dont ever stop
people ask me what time of day iwork and i say all the time
sir let me ask you to discuss very briefly the character of monk in light of his freedom and inevitability and soon
monk he was the it sidon tre read this and i mill have to remember just who monk was
right now ii thought it was one of the short stories
oh yes the one that went to the penitentiary was sent to the penitentiary
well he was a probably amor on that just wanted to get along just wanted enough to eat and probably liked for people to speak kindly to him
he got involved in in a crime which he didnt commit was sent to the penitentiary and was used as a tool by an evil man that wanted to get revenge on the warden
he was innocent and innocence possibly has no safe place in this world that you cant be that innocent and survive in it that you ve got to have a little of evil in your nature to cope with the world and mankind
do you think that man changes chiefly through economic changes that educational measures for example have rather little impact
noi think that he withstands economic changes pretty well
the only thing that will will help him will change him in my opinion is education
if we ever do get education in this country
i mean the schools that children goto
that that is that is the hope some of us have been very interested in the psychological aspects of segregation
i should be interested to know whether you believe that hope for that problem lies in education
i think if we improve the schools integration of schools would solve itself
i think that if the schools were up to the standard of the best that went there only the best could stay and the ones that went in would be so busy working they wouldnt have time to bother about what color who was sitting next to them
and i my hope is that all this uproar over integration will improve schools to that point
to get rid of the emotional problem the old folks will probably have to die off
the tragedy is that right now white people and colored people simply do not like and trust each other what are the greatest defects that you see in our current education system other than this mediocrity mass leveling thing
problem the old folks will probably have to die off
the tragedy is that right now white people and colored people simply do not like and trust each other what are the greatest defects that you see in our current education system other than this mediocrity mass leveling thing that certainly applies
the level of the school of the classes is at the lowest so that the one at the foot of the class wont be made to feel inferior
and in ever could understand why he shouldnt be made to feel inferior since he is
along with this business of conforming this business of respectability so often comes in
do you have any particular ideas or opinions on this particularly in terms of the conflict between being a member of the human race yes but also not getting lost in it in terms of the super respectable should also to some degree be a conforming person
yes you ve got to do a certain amount of compromising in order to have room to be free as who was it said fear god sir and the police
that there s simply not room on the earth and it dbe pretty lonely to be too free
and then also you probably wouldnt know what freedom was unless you had some boundaries to it that my freedom must stop where the end of your nose begins
ones got to be conscious of that took now what the freedom is that he s trying to preserve and fight for do you think at this time that economic factors are influencing policies about segregation much
are there largely the difficulties are largely the results of prejudices prejudices based on on other matters such as the fear of the sexual intermingling
i would say that the quarrel was in the beginning economic that in my country anyway the south i mean mississippi where the agrarian economy was based on the necessity for the cheapest sort of labor that the whiteman didnt want to lose his negro peon really
he dressed it up in all sorts of emotional conditions because the poor whiteman who was in actual economic conflict with the negro for the same crop on the same sort of poor land could respond to that
the whiteman would see the negro with with the same poor land as he but and with worse tools with worse stock yet would seem to be happier to make a better living for his family
all that whiteman had to justify himself was that he was white so he was better than the negro so he then he wouldnt have to say im a worse farmer than he is
he d say that dont matter
im better than he is because im white
i think that had a great deal to do with it in my country apart from that notion of mine that because of our mutual past the whiteman and and the blackman simply dont like each other and cant trust each other which is a condition i dont know what to do about that
it would take a psychiatrist or psychologist to eradicate that do you think the whiteman trusts the whiteman
he will yes
that s sort of a general general statement a general answer
he will distrust the whiteman for anyone of a number of reasons
he he may have indigestion or he may have had dealings with another whiteman that looked like him or had the same name but he will distrust the colored man at once because the colored man has black skin not because of his trade or profession or his appearance simply because he has a black skin dont you think that this is the rationalization of the person in order to discharge by channeling his hostilities on something
yes if you grant that that hostility is a an inability to trust a man of another race because of the color of his skin well what i mean is that there is not any basic hostility to a negro to a colored man but the only thing is that we are notable to show this hostility to come out at people and we can find somebody on whom we can show this hostility because he has a different color
i mean its something where people can unify and forget their inter hostilities in between themselves people on the west coast of this country distrust japanese because they re japanese
there are other people that distrust jewish people because they re jewish
but all white people seem tome to distrust negroes not white people on the west coast to distrust negroes but all white people seem to distrust negroes that they do not like negroes its there s near as as i can see without any geographical reason as the californian has for not liking japanese do you think this is true of european white person too
it seems to be that they got along with with negroes very well until suddenly a lot of negroes began to appear in in european countries
i have known italians and french and germans
of course in the german could have been something of nazism that still hung on
but any among all any white people where there have been enough negroes to where the negro was not a novelty and a curiosity i could think that i could feel that distrust and that dislike do you have any idea how this started in the beginning do you think its the influence of our culture
i would say yes because i dont know people too well of other cultures if you mean by our culture what we call the christian culture
i dont knowhow russians siberian s might feel toward negroes if it would be instinctive with them too
i dont know that
i would think that some of it would be because of our culture yes m
certainly that s true in in my part of the south where part of our culture has been that agrarian economy in which the negro was inferior because it was necessary that he be either a slave or ape on
it seems tome that in this country once the negro was freed of that the his condition in that agrarian economy then the culture his culture and the whiteman s culture dont touch anymore except in the installment plan automobiles and jukeboxes things like that do you feel that this innate whatever type of dislike for colored people by white people is going to cause a terrific long lasting struggle in the south if the supreme court decision is forced on the south in regard to pressure for ending segregation
it would be along time
i think that that supreme court decision has caused a great deal of of trouble
it has setback a gradual change of of the negroes condition for the better in the south but it has not changed it in the long run
in the long run it was bound to come
the supreme court had to make that decision
i would say that within five hundred years the negro race in this country will have disappeared
it will be fifty years before negroes are permitted in white schools in mississippi i would guess though
that would be the last of the states
and that maybe because mississippi is last in literacy or they may goh and in hand anyway how much effect do you think the exodus of the negro will have on the situation down
its changed a lot but that s a question like which was first the chicken or the egg
we still dont know whether the invention of machines that will do the work which mules and human hands had to do once has caused the negro to move or whether the negro leaving the south has brought in the machinery
but if there s been a definite change
in my county in the last twelve months there were thirty six hundred negroes left for the north out of that there will be usually ten percent will stay for a year or two and then comeback
but they are the negro is leaving mississippi going to the big cities
it it maybe that his young people were drafted
they saw something of the city and just like durban life and are are going to the big town
because there were fifteen hundred white people left lafayette county too
and they were the ex soldier that had seen something of the world of city life and didnt want to spend the rest of their lives looking at empty fields feeding mules and running tractors to raise cotton
you re not entirely dispassionate about this problem are you
i mean you show concern as a person about what you might call social problems
as a writer would you be able to divorce yourself entirely from passionate feelings
i hope that im not dispassionate about it but i think that a writer had better save all his passion to making credible the human beings which he creates from the observation the experience and the imagination to set into dramatic instances of mans struggle in the condition to have any left to preach to anyone about segregation or about tolerance or any anything else
if he does that he had better stop trying to be a fiction writer and and bean essayist or a propagandist im quite sure that that you cant keep out of of your work your own opinions and and convictions about things but i think the writer has no business dragging in his opinions
he d better stick to dealing with man in his dilemma in his predicament his struggles with the human heart the old verities that he has always had to struggle with which have outlasted the changes in culture economics but now what we about something depends on how we have had our experience
i mean i can see to the same thing you will see different things and everyone else is going to see different things
anything that we use our imagination our observation is just based on our previous experience
surely
it it wont chase change the basic fact we look at
i mean by the verities the people that the facts that young people fallin love and want to sleep together that man wants certain things and he knows if he gets it the police may get him
he knows that the weak should should be protected by the strong that he should have combe capable of compassion of pity of courage of honor
i grant you that everyone in looking at these instances will see them from a slightly different point of view with a slightly different illumination on it but its basically the same truths which he looks at dont you think that these are the basic experiences that the culture gives to us
i mean to a certain extent we have all the same ideas to a certain extent because the culture has in cultured them to us
if you goto another culture they wont do the same
they wont feel the same maybe
the basic areas are going to change to a certain extent
well they are ephemeral changes unless we mean different things by culture
tome apart of of our american culture is the pressure of everybody to throw his old caraway every year and buy a new one
its the pressure of not to read but to listen to the television to the radio
that is what i mean by our culture
i dont mean that the tradition of of of wisdom that we could get from from solitude or from from reading books
because if we mean different things by culture then we are at slightly cross purposes mr
faulkner do you think we get certain things from reading books
and im sure there are certain ways to communicate feelings about things and i have a feeling from your books that you are trying to communicate certain very strong feelings that you have about things
now you you dont do them in an obvious sermonizing way but ido think that your books that come to memory are to a certain extent books which propound certain systems of values
and i dont mean again to sound like that by that standing on a soapbox but for instance the one on on segregation intruder in the dust i think you you do more than just sermons
i think you make certain points about people and their values
yes m
i agree with you but they are are coincidental
the writer is too busy writing about people struggling with their own hearts with others or with environment that his own convictions and opinions about injustices come out but he s not at that moment concerned in telling the reader this is what i think about injustice or morality
he s simply trying to take from his experience and imagination and observation people and make them stand up and assume enough of reality to you might say casta shadow behind them and themselves move engage in the in the struggles which have been mans nature ever since he became man for for love for for pleasure for money to be brave to be honest as much as he can
maybe this sounds like a stupid question but why does the writer write
is it just to depict people in action or what they redoing
why would you be motivated to write if you dont particularly have a point to prove or a sermon to preach
is it just to put down what you observe and see how it works out or
could you comment on that
yes
first you are demon driven
you can the lp it
also its fun its the one occupation you have found which is fun because you re never bored by it because you cant do it
there s no such thing as satiety
you never can write the book which you want to write
it will never quite match that dream so you always have something to getup tomorrow to do
in the last analysis as is aida while ago you know that you re here for a specific time which is comparatively very short that someday you ll pass through the wall into what you dont know and you will have left on that wall simply k il roy was here
its not especially for for glory nor fame but to just leave a scratch on it
its that it was me that made that scratch
it wasnt anybody else but me
just old bill shakespeare or whatever his name is
do you have any idea where this demon comes from or why some people seem to have it
others wish they have it or try to convince themselves they do and others dont
well it maybe that its from providence or or the boss of whoever runs things that feels its necessary to keep a record of of frail fragile mans struggle with his dilemma that never has licked him and probably never will
maybe its necessary that record be kept and the painter the musician the people that delve into mans mechanisms to find what makes him do and leave a record of it are all leaving a record of mans successful struggle not his not that he prevailed over his dilemma but that atleast he endured it
and in a sense he has prevailed because he continues to reproduce and will still endure it and as i said the last sound in the dying world will be two folks going somewhere how old were you when you first were aware of the possession by this devil that you must write
oh when i got slowed down
as long as i was writing as i was hot in ever had time to think about it
it was fun
but when i got long in years and found that it was a chore
it was work to write an did say well ive done a few books now so i think ill quit
i found out that i wasnt going to quit and that in ever would quit
and then i decided that it was evidently it was a demon that it certainly wasnt me and it certainly wasnt any inclination of mine to keep going
i just couldnt quit
it was less trouble togo on and write than to fight the demon off
how old were you when you first started to write to as a career as away of life to
were you in a teens
i had always been scribbling as soon as i learned to spell i from what my mother tells mei was inventing fantastic al romances mainly to get out of having to do chores at home before that
but in ever became a serious writer until around i was around twenty two three years old
okay back to what do you think will happen to the artisan that you just named a few minutes ago when our schools become all scientific when we copy the russians for our education
oh he he will his with the help of his demon he will withstand that too
he he wont goto school if he can help it but if he s compelled togo to school that wont bother him
because even a totalitarian government a in t going to make him goto school longer than eight hours a day
that still leaves him sixteen hours to sleep and eat and read dos toy ev sky in
hell find plenty of time
that wont stop him
because he s as i said he s doing something that s fun
in my opinion its the most fun of any occupation a man could have is to take the old shopworn material and try to make something just a little new out of it with it
something that wasnt quite here yesterday
never to do it
always to spring out of bed the next morning rubbing your hands eager togo back to work at it because this time it ll come off
you know it wont but it may it sounds very much like psychotherapy
it probably is pretty good psychotherapy
could you discuss your feeling about genius and and the artist and maybe maybe in relative in relationship to madness
what is a genius
well i think that he is a madman but he s driven by his demon so that he has nt got time to be a public nuisance with it that he has a has an escape for it that he concentrate on his piece of marble with his hammer and his chisel or his canvas or his ream of typewriter paper and he can discharge its of or the rest of the time he is socially immobilized and nobody pays any attention to him that he s very likely insane too a lot of our patients are either writers or want to be or artists in one way or another
and are coming really pretty close sometimes to being good
it often puzzles me as to why or what is the difference as far as some dont quite gel and others do
probably that s why they become your patients
they they couldnt quite gel and couldnt bear it that others couldnt quite gel and they their frustration is channeled into some harmless condition or is it sir the tension that some have been in is sobig that they are completely disorganized in their activities and others who have been under pressure and have some good parts in themselves and then they reproduce that and can develop these ideas in order to give them more security in their work or in their capacity
i mean they ido believe that genius dont grow in a family where the equilibrium is very good
i mean they they are under pressure themselves and they feel unhappy
they feel bad and they have to develop certain things that are going to make them feel more comfortable have some fun and get something out of their lives
i have seen a lot of people that have were very brilliant but they were in a class for example where they had not to spend too much time and they have been becoming lazy and they didnt work because they were able to do to produce very easily and when there was something that had to be done with difficulty they never produce anymore
but i have seen people that have been under pressure and they they spend a lot of time and they they area real genius
i have seen people that were under pressure in very difficult situations that have become genius and people that have had a very easy life never have produced anything
i cant say
of course you would know more better than i because you would have had a wider range of observation than ii would make a one simple more or less hard and fast rule
if you have a first rate demon then he s going to take care of everything else for you
does that mean that you place little emphasis on craft and such things as revision and oh sure
there s always somebody will correct the grammar and punctuate it for you you dont need to worry about style
get it down on paper is all you need to do
i think all the i think what doctor nei grim s was saying he feels stress and unfortunate situations are necessary for genius
do you think that s so
no siri dont think so but then doctor nei grim shada wider range to observe than meth a the s interested in in people as people
im interested in people as material you might say that i really dont dont give a damn about that did you have a very hard and unfortunate life
no sir
as far as i know i had a good life
i had had a very pleasant one you dont think your reactions are in in response to stress
no sir
i think that the demon lit on my shoulders i dont know where he came from or why he picked on me
that s the only explanation i have
it it maybe that i took up writing as a what do you call it a protest to being against being small and insignificant that i wanted to be big and brave and handsome and rich
it could be that
i dont know
what was the actions of your family all along
well my father thought that the oldest son ought togo to work and be ready to takeover the family when his time came and i wanted to be a tramp and we never did see eye to eye on that but i got along all right with it
well thankyou all we enjoyed it tremendously
i think ill take the moderators privilege and ask the first question if i may
id like to know a little bit about the circumstances of the composition of the bear
can you remember when it was that you first thought of it and put it down
i couldnt couldnt say
that story is probably a summation of of my whole experience from the first time i was big enough togo into the woods where bears were with a gun until i became a man probably that story maybe autobiographical in the sense that it was that little boys confrontation with something big and important for he himself to find how he would meet it to as hemingway says to meet it with grace
what i mean is probably i was composing that story from the first moment i went into the what we call the big woods and and realized what it was
there would be bigger animals wilder animals than the rabbits and possums and things that i had experience with when i was not big enough yet to carry a gun into the woods you really began composing it when you were is acs age
i think so yes or remembered it and then when i had acquired some skill in the craft of writing to write my own biography against something which was a fine pleasure tome a worthwhile pursuit which is probably apart of any boys life any american boy unless he has was bred and lived all his life in the city
i imagine there are not many of you here who have nt hunted
when you first have a gun rabbits possums and then you got big enough to hunt bigger game than that
have you written anything else about boon hog gan beck after the bear
he is one of my stable of people that i consider myself the owner and proprietor of
i think i have used him occasionally at need
i dont recall now specifically what stories or books but i believe i have used him
but he has nt been the central character in a story like he was there or one of the central characters
since you put such meaning into the hunt could you tellus just why you hunted when you were a young boy or or what meaning the hunt has to you
the hunt was simply a symbol of pursuit
most of of anyone s life is a pursuit of something
that is the only alternative to life is immobility which is death
this was a symbolization of the pursuit which is a normal part of of anyone s life while he stays alive told in terms which were familiar tome and and dramatic tome
the protagonist could have been anything else beside that bear
i simply told a story which was a natural normal part of anyone s life in a familiar and tome interesting terms without any deliberate intent to put symbolism in it
i was simply telling something which was in this case the child the need the compulsion of the child to adjust to the adult world
it show he does it how he survives it whether he is destroyed by trying to adjust to the adult world or whether despite his small size he does adjust within his capacity
and always to learn something to learn something of not only to pursue but to overtake and then to have the compassion not to destroy
to to catch to touch and then let go because then tomorrow you can pursue again
if you destroy what you caught then its gone
its finished
and that tome is sometimes the greater part of valor but always its the greater part of pleasure not to destroy what you have pursued
the pursuit is the is the thing not the reward not the gain
yes ma am sir you explained to us that ike the story of ike in the bear is in a manner of speaking autobiographical
does ike s theory of a curse on the land in anyway reflect your feeling of a curse on the land
nowell if it if it should it would not be maybe as strong as ike s
i think that any author should should put on the a full page in his book that he is not responsible for the ideas expressed by any of his characters their ideas or political convictions or or religious beliefs i think that ike probably carried that a little further than than i might have because it was necessary for my story that he should that he was a he was a poet in his way an idealist which i probably am not or anyway not as good a one as ike
a central theme of ab salom ab salom
is that s ut pen will not or cannot acknowledge charles bon as his son
why does he not do this why why why does he leave it to henry
it it seemed tome it would have been more in keeping with s ut pens character to confession of it to bon or if he had even destroyed bon so that he well he didnt acknowledge bon for the reason that bon was part negro
to have acknowledged bon as his son would have destroyed the very dream the drive which had compelled him togo through hardship and and suffering to begin with
he couldnt acknowledge bon as his son did he acknowledge c lyte m nest ra as his daughter
no
well that would not have mattered because c lyte m nest raw as a female
the important thing to him was he should establish a line of dukes you see
he was going to create a dukedom
he d have to have a male descendent
he would have to establish a dukedom which would be his revenge on the white virginian who told him togo to the backdoor
and so he he to have a negro half negro for his son would have wrecked the whole dream so he couldnt
if he had thought that it would ever be exposed that bon was his son he may have killed bon himself
if it d ever come to that point he would destroy bon just as he would destroy any other individual that got in his way sir you said that you as the author are not responsible for what your character is saying
how about the language that they use
i noticed that some of the dialogue in the bear was a little bit above the level of the average southerner speaking as someone who has
did you mean that to be realistic or is that just poetic license
i think that s a license that the writer should be permitted
he is trying to take an instant in mans struggle within the human dilemma and isolate it in some dramatic form and he has nt got the time to do it that living people would would have
they would have days and weeks to tell this story but he has got to tell it in thirty minutes or two or three hours or at most two days
he has got to emphasize overemphasize at times
he s got to under emphasize at others so that is his the privilege of his craft to put a sort of poetry into the mouths of people that in real life would be incapable of speaking poetry
he sticks just enough to the natural and to dialect to make what they say believable eventhough you say well he couldnt have expressed this idea in this way
you say well anyway he would have expressed it in this language
that s one of the privileges that you must give the writer that he is sticking to the fundamental truth but he can distort fact just a little if in order to get his story told in a moving dramatic way
sir how did you happen to choose old ben
he was the biggest untamed creature in the woods at that time
the the other the indian was gone the the buffalo the other big wild creatures had been eliminated by that time
only the bear remained
he was the biggest wild thing to be a protagonist in the story of this little boys adjustment to the adult world then so i think that maybe old ben was an on fictional character then
no there s no writer ever will be satisfied to take any character from real life put him in the book because he s convinced he can do a much better at that than god can
he s going to improve and warp and distort no matter how much he concentrates on trying to tell stick to facts
a writer simply couldnt stick to facts
the truth really is not in him
that s why they call it fiction
yes maa mid like togo back to charles bonin ab salom ab salom
i have the impression that up until very near the end of the book that he did not realize that he was s ut pens son
because he s several times mentioned wondering what the secret was that his mother kept and worried about
and yet about twenty or thirty pages from the end of the book he says to henry that its the miscegenation and not the incest that you fear in my marriage to judith
so at what point did did he find this out and how did he find out
i think that bon knew all the time that his mother was part n egress but during bons childhood that was not important
he grew up in in the indies and new orleans where that wasnt too important
his mother was a wealthy woman
she could have called herself a creole whether she had negro blood along with the french or not
it became important only when bon realized that it was important to his father
i think that bongo tinto that business well of course because he formed a friendship with henry and felt that he that henry the ignorant country boy had given him a sort of worship an admiration and a worship which which he enjoyed
then when he saw the sort of stiff necked man that henry s father was and knew that that was his father too he in away had given his father a chance to say i will acknowledge you but if you if ido openly and you stay here you will wreck what i have devoted my life to and so take my love and goi think bon would have done but this oldman was afraid to do that
and bon tempted him to hold him over the coals in partly in revenge on his treatment of his bons mother until bon got involved too deeply
no bon knew that he was a negro but until he found it was important tosu t pen that wasnt important to him that he was a gentleman had been well bred cultured much better bred and cultured than henry himself was
did bon love judith or was he just using her
i think he loved her
i think that he loved her
he knew that if she knew that he was part negro with her training and background it would have destroyed her too
returning to the bear why did you put part five after part four
that story was part of a novel
it was the pursuit of the bear was simply what you might call a a dangling clause in the description of that man when he was a young boy
when it was taken from the book and printed as a short story the publisher who is very considerate has a great respect for for all work and for mine in particular he would not have altered one word of that without asking me
and he didn task me
if he had had told me he was going to print it separately i would have said take this out
this doesnt belong in this as a short story
its part of the novel but not apart of the story
but rather than togo ahead and do that without asking mei wasnt available at that time he printed it as it was
it it doesnt belong in there as a short story
the way to read that is to skip that when you come to it
mr faulkner in ab salom ab salom
is anyone of the people who talks about s ut pen have the right view or is it more or less a case of thirteen ways of looking at a blackbird with none of them getting it right
that s it exactly
i think that noone individual can can look at truth
it it it blinds you
you look at it and and you you see one phase of it
someone else looks at it and sees a slightly awry phase of it but taken alltogether the truth is in what they saw though nobody saw the truth intact so so these are are true as far as as miss rosa and as quentin saw it
quentin s father saw what what he believed was truth
that was all he saw
but the oldman was himself a little too big for for people no greater in stature than quentin and miss rosa and mr comp son to see all at once
it would ve taken probably a wiser or more tolerant or more sensitive or more thoughtful person to see him as he was it was as you say thirteen ways looking at a blackbird
but the truth i would like to think comes out that when the reader has read all these thirteen different ways of looking at the blackbird the reader has his own fourteenth image of that blackbird which i would like to think is the true one mr
faulkner mr coldfield in ab salom ab salom retreats into the attic when the war between the states starts
now why did he do that
was it because he was sort of a conscientious objector or was he all or part coward
no he he was probably by religious scruples a conscientious objector
also he was very likely a unionist that he hated that threat to the dissolution of the union that he had nt enough courage to do anything about it except to hide his head in the s and
but i think that he was probably a unionist
he probably came from from eastern tennessee where the people were unionists at that time
his background was a tradition of of fidelity to the united states as it was
he had no agrarian tradition behind him in which slavery was an important part of it mr
faulkner was mr coldfield an honest manor was he
he was probably honest in a timorous sort of way
he was a man probably without a great deal of courage
he was honest simply because that wasnt very risky
that he was cold and i imagine selfish but but in his dealings behind the counter of his store he was probably honest because that was less trouble and less risk
he was not rapacious
he had no driving desire to a massa lot of money
why does major de spain stop the railroad when the bear is the small bear is stuck in the tree
the bear would have stayed up the tree and starved until the train stopped running and it got quiet
then he would comedown again
but he would stay up the tree and then when he decided things were quiet and would start down another train would pass
he would go backup the tree and stay there until he starved
that was the reason sir are there any real life sam fathers left
well in the sense that too much time has passed there could be nobody half negro slave and half an indian chief
he might be one eighth an indian chief by now but he couldnt have been the son of an indian chief and a negro slave anymore
and so he would be changed warped softened a little by a different a tamer environment than sam fathers grew up in
in the creation of the bear were you in anyway influenced by melville
a writer i have said several times this year and last year too is influenced by everything he ever reads
he he himself doesnt bother he know she doesnt think it important enough to say i was influenced at this moment by so and so
he is omnivorous voracious and completely amoral
he is influenced by everything he ever reads
he will rob and steal right and left with complete impunity because he s not only perfectly willing but he s flattered when people after him rob and steal from him that if its good enough for another writer to steal from him it must have been pretty good so if anything he s flattered im sure i was influenced by melville influenced by flaubert by the old testament by everything that i ever read in the days when i read voraciously with no judgment
how did you happen to start using this particular means of communication your style
how did you hit on this
that just happened so
i my opinion is that the book creates its own style
the writer is too busy to bother with style
he s too busy to bother with grammar even or standard punctuation
get it down and somebody in the publishing office will correct it for you the main thing is to get it down and the exigencies of the story the people in it compel and create the style
that if you begin to write style then that implies that you a in t got very much to put in it and so you begin to write prose and rhetoric which is all right and pleasant enough but its hardly worth anybody s trouble to read
in sartori s did you make simon the negro house man a tricky or comic character or did something corrupt him to make him
that was just what the white folks saw in him because his training his environment had taught him that that s what the white folks look to see in negroes and negroes got along better if they act like black faced comedians when white people were looking at them
that s one of the negros tragedies
no that was just simons sunday suit you might say
in the bear who is your favorite character
well in ever never thought about that i probably haven tone
i like all of the mii admire the fy ce dog very much but i had in ever thought which one was my favorite character mr
faulkner getting back to your style do you find that at first in your writing that you manipulated a good manythings and then it became easier and easier and and probably no longer seems to worry about such things as revising and send it directly to the publishing house
no it never has got any easier
if anything its harder but do you manipulate and change words
sometimes until it comes right
sometimes i dont have to
in ever have to change a word
sometimes iwork the thing six and seven and eight and nine years
but in ever know
that s part of the charm of writing tome is the absolute uncertainty of it yes but at any rate its not just a spontaneous thing now
well sometimes it is yes
not always
not always mr
faulkner you said that in ab salom ab salom
there were thirteen ways of looking at it
what is your way
how do you feel about thomas s ut pen
that the truth about thomas s ut pen came out of all the thirteen different people that looked at him ime anime an like you said about caddy you said that caddy was the darling of your heart
is he the darling of your heart
well i said only that i worked hardest and anguished and suffered moreover that book over the sound and the fury it i feel toward that as as the parent does toward the afflicted child maybe that i worked the longest and the hardest over it and it still is not as good as it should be so did iso is ab salom ab salom
not as good as it should be but then i didnt have to anguish over that as much
i could bring myself to the point of say in give done the best i can with it and write something else now
let it alone
it took along time with the sound and the fury for that
tome he s consistent that he approached the s ut pen family with with the same oph thal mia that he approached his own troubles that he probably never saw anything very clearly that his was just one of the thirteen ways to look at s ut pen and his may have been the one of the most erroneous
probably his friend mccann on had a much clearer picture of s ut pen from what quentin told him than quentin himself would
no its its s ut pens story
but then everytime any character gets into a a book no matter how minor he is actually telling his biography
that s all anyone ever does he tells his own biography talking about himself
in a thousand different terms but himself
quentin was still trying to get god to tell him why
in ab salom ab salom maybe he was in the sound and the fury
siri d like some help on understanding the what i call the bedroom scene in the fourth section of the bear
you made one statements he is lost
she was born lost
can you help me to understand what you meant by that
who does that refer to that refers to ike m cc as lins wife
in in that section yes i think i remember now
she from her background her tradition sex was something evil that it had to be justified by acquiring property
she was ethically a prostitute
sexually she was frigid
i think what he mean the knew that there was no warmth that he would ever find from her no understanding nono chance ever to accept love or return love because she was incapable of it
that s probably what he meant and i wondered why she laughed
he would ever find from her no understanding nono chance ever to accept love or return love because she was incapable of it
that s probably what he meant and i wondered why she laughed and laughed when
she realized then that he was going to give up the land
she married him because she was going to be chat elaine of a plantation
and then she found he was going to give all that away and the only revenge she knew was to not to deny him sexually that was the only triumphs he had
and she was going to make him suffer for that just as much as she could to get even with him so that she intended from the beginning of her marriage to deny him this one thing that he had requested until it was useful in blackmailing
well she assumed when they got married that she was going to be chat elaine of a plantation and they would have children
and she was going to be as according to the rules of the book a good wife to him shed still be frigid and cold and a shrew probably but shed be a good wife then when he was going to throw the plantation away for idealistic folly all she the only revenge she had was that
atleast he would have no children from her
he d have no wife from her
and she hoped well ike excuse me sir
and she hoped that he would would make him grieve well ike says here did she realize when he was saying this that he did not mean it
did not mean what
that he would go back to the land
she must have understood he was not going to retract and take his heritage
yes im sure she was convinced of that no matter what he might have said
if she had been the kind of wife he needed and been able to give him love and companionship and had stuck by him and had children and had a home for him do you think that his that he would have ever compromised with his ideals
after all he had no training noway of providing for her
i would say since we are supposing if she had been that sort of woman she would have understood his hatred of that condition
she might have been practical enough to say this is the way well do it
we cant abandon these people
but lets do it this way
and he would have said you re wiser than i
lets try it your way
that s possible
i would like to think that
but he would have stuck to his position that i will not profit from this which is wrong and sinful
sir one of the most interesting aspects of the bear tome is the conflict between man and the wilderness
i would like to ask you if you intend for the reader to sympathize more with old ben and his conflict with hunters or with the hunters and their conflict with old ben
well not sympathize
i doubt if the writer is asking anyone to sympathize to choose sides
that is the readers right
what the writer is asking is compassion understanding that change must alter must happen and change is going to alter what was
that no matter how fine anything seems it cant endure because it once it stops abandons motion it is dead
its to have compassion for the for the anguish that the wilderness itself may have felt by being ruthlessly destroyed by axes by by men who simply wanted to make that earth grow something they could sell for a profit which brought into it a condition based on an evil like human bondage
its not to choose sides at all just to compassionate the the good splendid things which change must destroy the splendid fine things which area part of mans past too part of mans heritage too
but they were obsolete and had togo
but that s no need to not feel compassion for them simply because they were obsolete
is that what you meant by the ending of this then that change must destroy all goodness
change if it is not controlled by wise people destroys sometimes more than it it brings
that unless some wise person comes along in in the in the middle of the change and takes charge of it change can destroy what is irreplaceable
if the reason for the change is base in motive
that is to clear the wilderness just to make cotton land to raise cotton on a on an agrarian economy of of peonage slavery is base because its not as good as that wilderness which it replaced
but if in the end that makes more education for more people and more food for more people more of the good things of life i mean by that to give man leisure to use what sup here instead of just leisure to ride around in automobiles then the it was worth destroying the wilderness
but if all if all the destruction of the wilderness does is to give more people more automobiles just to ride around in then the wilderness was better
in the bear does boon hog gan beck have some particular traitor characteristic that made him the choice of of person to kill the bear rather than sam fathers or ike or some of the older hunters
well yes boon had his size his physical size and strength
he had the mentality of a child and he wouldnt stop to think this maybe a little dangerous to run in there
he had the capacity to love that dog enough to risk being mauled to save that dogs life that boon with his unreliability his lack of of intellect had godlike attributes if he ever met the opportunity to show them
and he met probably his great moment in life when he could use his strength and and his capacity to be be brave to save to protect the weak from the strong eventhough the weak was just a dog
also boon was a descendant of the same indian clan that sam fathers was descended from
sam fathers whether boon knew it or not was descended from the chief
he was boons superior in the woods because he had better blood boon was boons chickasaw ancestor was probably just a hunter
sam seven though his mother was a negro his father was a chief a king maybe boon was doing what he knew sam expected him to do
if i understood you correctly earlier you said that you did not use any intentional symbolism in the bear
but yet towards the end of the story well after the end ike appears from now on he s going to lead a very christ like existence and he becomes a carpenter and was that not intentional
well not deliberately intentional
i mean this the symbolism is literary
its apart of of anyone s past background
so these symbols will appear just as the way you you pronounce your words appear
you dont know where you learned to pronounce words the way you do because you you inherited that or it came from your early environment and these symbols which are christian symbols area part of the christian background which all of us in this country came from
that s why i think critics read into books what the writer didnt know was there because he reads from the same background of christian symbolism which the writer unconsciously wrote from
and im sure that these symbols are all there but the writer himself dont know it till somebody points them out to him
because he is too busy simply telling about people to have to hunt around to use symbols to tell about people with
the symbols insert themselves just as the proper word does
because that is apart of his culture part of his literary background
what is the function of boons breakdown
no function
he had had gone beyond even his strength the strain
he had heat the last he killed sam fathers by sam fathers command just as a king would say to one of his faithful body servants when he has lost the war and lost the battle dont let my head fall into the enemy s hands
boon had simply exceeded his own emotional and physical strength
he just stayed awake too long
what significance do you attach to the dog lion left out of the story why wasnt the bear killed
well that s sort of like saying how would shakespeare have got along without his grave diggers
that is its more than atmosphere
its necessary to to create the full complete atmospheric picture in which man faces the natural normal dilemmas of of his condition
that lion was simply necessary just like the bear was necessary there was no intent that they should symbolize anything
they were just necessary components to a moving dramatic story which approached a climax he was just needed
yes yes
just like the boy was needed as a protagonist on one side just as the bear was needed just as the wilderness was needed as they re props to tell the story which was a boy to face the adult world and to see how he copes with it because he was apart of the wilderness
well the wilderness where the be arran had not been tamed yet
men went into it but they didnt live there
they went into match their strength against the wilderness which was older and stronger than they were yes
the edges of it would be gnawed up but but where the be arran was not tamed yet
but when they went into that bear country they had to accept the bears conditions not their s anymore
the only advantage they had were guns
and the boy who he met the the symbol of the wilderness had a chance to use his gun
he didnt use it
he was testing himself
extreme end of the bear where boon is at the base of the tree gun to shoot the squirrels he has up the tree is that showing that boon is unable to cope with modern instruments like the gun
the only way he could kill something was by the way he killed the bear
gun and not being able to hit anything when he uses it
no that tome was a promise of optimism a belief of mine that man no matter how frail he is is tougher than anything that he can stand anything that boon having served his purpose in this the old bears saga and sam fathers finish was still going on he was still boon
if he were needed again by another old ben another sam father she would have served again
that he was that tome is a sign of of optimism that man is pretty good after all that even his moments of heroism dont necessarily need to destroy
of mans dilemma now would the terms of this dilemma in our current society
his struggle is shall ido what i can to get rid of what i know of evil
or shall i say well that s none of my business and ill let it alone
if what i know to be evil injustice worries meso i must do something about it
or how can i as frail a siam and as solitary a siam against avast weight of public opinion who wants to let this alone
that s his struggle and his dilemma and his dramatic moment in terms of of story is when he faces this problem this battle does he lick it or does it lick him
if if it beats his brains outdoes he still look good while he is having his head battered or does he turn tail and run from it
they are they are his problems willi be as brave as i want to be
willi be as honest as i want to be
yes that s right
yeshe wants to do something about it
it seems like in the ending of the bear when he breaks down and starts yelling getaway getaway
dont toucha one of them they re mine they re mine
instead of taking that as a sort of an optimistic intention i thought of thought of it more so as a warning to mantha the cannot in the end conquer nature that in the end nature will win out and that in order to lead a good life a man must beat peace with nature rather than trying to constantly conquer it
well im not too certain that man could can beat peace with nature because nature a in t very peaceful itself
i think in in this instance boon he did everything full out
if it was something worthwhile and he could be convinced by someone he believed in that he should go full out at i the would
just as he he went at the bear and just as he helped sam fathers to die
he was hunting squirrels and he had got the squirrels up that tree and the gun as usual let him down
if anything that s a contempt ive commentary on the machine that man think she can depend on when he cant
it lets him down
and boons machine let him down
but that had nt frightened boon
he could fix that thing just as long as somebody else didnt come along with a machine that did work and kill all his squirrels
does the miscegenation and incest of roth edmunds in delta autumn complete a cycle of incest and miscegenation begun by old m cc asl in and only interrupted by the goodness of buck and buddy and ike in the middle
yes it it came home
it if you if that s what you mean by complete the cycle yes it did
the purpose of having the annual the annual hunt just a just the opportunity to allow these people to commune again with nature nature it was togo hunting
they liked togo hunting and that was it that simple
they were going to hunt deer bear and deer they were not going to hunt bear and deer but to keep a yearly rendezvous with a bear they did not intend to kill
well now that s that s that little boy remember that has gone into the adult world with with all the illusions of something fine and splendid
the old people when they first went there they had that same thought but now they went back to hunt
it could have also they could go back because they liked it because they liked the liked the freedom
they liked the sense of of atavistic desire togo back to the beginning also they for two weeks they were free of the womenfolk
there were all sorts of reasons why they would like togo
it could be summed up simply because they liked the two weeks in the bottom during the hunt
they wouldnt have paused to dig out the other reasons as the little boy did
they could have been there
but those men would never meet on the street say now boys lets hookup the mules and go back to commune for two weeks with nature
they d say lets go back there and kill that big bear that s there
mr faulkner sir after sam had taken taken captured lion boon took the dog
now why didnt sam mind that
sam was a king
he was going to have his hunter folks take care of the dogs and horses
he turned the dog over to a grooms am was a king
he wasnt going to sleep with a dog
he d let boon do that
sir you said that this story you think comes out of your own background
was there really a dog actual dog that might have inspired lion
we usually had one dog of that general type in our pack of bear dogs
he was a usually part airedale
the hounds would would trail the bear and would bay him
and the airedale would would hold him there until the men on the horses could getup
lion as he is in the story is a fabrication but he s based on the dog that we would usually have in our pack always keep one of that sort
sir have you ever the idea of
no not forme mr
faulkner i hope this is not too obvious a question but this is not the sort of thing novels
as were ad your books we see dogs mules colored people white people indians half breeds who are brave
bravery it permeates your work
could you say something about bravery in general
do you think that a man should feel that he has to be brave or do you think that men are brave by definition
do you think also is there less bravery today than there was forty years ago
noi dont think so
i think there s that bravery is like like the water in the earth
it it dont diminish
it might alter
sometimes its clouds sometimes its its rivers in the land
sometimes its back in the ocean again but its the same quantity of water
its constant that i would say that man falls into courage just as you walk along the street and fall into manhole that no nobody possesses it at a this beck and call always that he himself never knows whether he will be able to be brave or not
quite often he is to his astonishment
i think that some people feel better to believe or have proof that they are brave that they may do dangerous things just as you take a drink
it makes you feelgood to know that you are brave
some people are content to believe that im going be brave but iain t going togo to much trouble to find outright now
but i would say that the quantity of it is a constant factor a constant apportioning to individual people that too manythings will have to do with with why you re brave at one particular moment
too much goes into it
maybe somebody s watching you
you want to look good so you re brave
you might be scared to death but for the moment you re brave because you want to look good to your sweetheart or to a friend or to newspapers or whatever one last question i remember i read most a good bit of your work about oh about six years a goi guess and i read it without any particular direction in no particular sequence
i can remember sort of struggling through it and trying to figure out the genealogical table to figure out whose family the people belong to and all
and the none day i read the oldman
in ever read the wild palms
i know it was published in conjunction with the oldman
in ever read that
but the oldman i remember struck me because as i remember basically it was a very simple story
the language was pretty straightforward
there were nt very many people involved in it
it was sort of a nice tight short novel i guess and it was into meat that time as i remember it was entirely it struck me as being entirely unlike i guess from the point of view of style if you want to use the term from anything else i dread of yours and i always was interested in how you thought about that particular piece of work in relation to the other things you ve you ve written
that s only half of of another book
they should never have been broken apart that way
that s half chapter by chapter with a book called the wild palms
they should be read together as i wrote them
that is simply a a background its a counterpoint in a fugue and tome to break them to pieces is just as dull as as listening to the lefthand part of of a piece of beethoven or or bach
it dont mean anything tome without both hands
that was not my idea to do that
that was the publishers
it was printed properly in a book called the wild palms
they were alternate chapters this was to emphasize and underline the other story
one was the story of a of a man and a woman who who fell in love and and were destroyed by it played against the background of a man who got involved with a woman and went through incredible trouble to get rid of her even togo back to the penitentiary to get rid of her
thankyou very much mr faulkner
thankyou
well when you goto the trouble to invent a private domain of your own then you re the master of time too i have the right i think to shift these things around wherever it sounds best and i can move them about in time and if necessary change their names
this would be or this happened
that is the more you write the more you ve got to compromise with such facts as time and place and so ive got to agree with mr gwynn and establish this somewhere in time so its about have you ever such an auction taking place
yes m
i bought one of these horses once they appeared in our country
every summer somebody would come in with another batch of them they were western range bred ponies pintos
had never had a bridle on them
had never seen shell corn before and they d brought be brought into our town and auctioned off for prices from three or four dollars up to six or seven and i bought this one for four dollars and seventy five cents
i was oh i reckon ten years old
my father at that time rana livery stable and there was a big man
he was six feet and a half tall
he weighed two hundred pounds but mentally he was about ten years old too and i wanted one of those horses
my father said well if you and buster can buy one for what money you ve saved you can have it
and so we went to the auction and we bought one for four dollars and seventy five cents
we got it home
we were going to gentle it
we had a two wheel cart made out of the front axle of a buggy with shafts on it and we fooled with that creature
it was a wild animal
it was a wild beast it wasnt a domestic animal at all and finally buster said that it was about ready so we had the cart in ashed
estelle probably remembers this
we put a croak er sack over the horses head and backed it into the cart with two niggers to fasten it into buckle traces and toggles and things and me and buster got in the seat and buster said all right boys let him go
and they snatched the sack off the horses head and it went across the lot
there was a big gate
the lane had turned at a sharp angle
it hung the inside wheel on the gatepost as it turned
we were down on one hub then
then about that time buster caught me by the back of the neck and threw me just like that and then he jumped off and the cart was scattered up that lane and we found the horse a mile away run into a dead end street
all he had left on him was just the ham es the harness was gone
that was a pleasant experience
but we kept that horse and gentled him to where i finally rode him but i loved that horse because that was my own horse
i bought that with my own money
how do you feel about your next novel or do you always feel that your next one is the best
well the one that im going to write this year is going to be the best
the one that i finished last year that s finished
that s behind me
there s nothing more i can do to that but im going to do one this year that s still better which is probably a happy attitude to have toward writing that is its its fun to do
its like some people find playing golf fun to door collecting stamps
if you ever get the perfect stamp there s nothing else to collect
if you ever write a book that suits you exactly there s nothing else to do and so you hope that you really wont write one as good as you think its going to be and of course you wont mr
faulkner do you feel that the gap between the people and the law that exists in spotted horses has closed any since then
the gap between the people and and the law
and the law uh huh
will you explain a little more of what that means the law is so inappropriate and and and we feel that its in the end its so ridiculous really
its its so far from the people and the way they live and it doesnt seem to apply to them
i just wondered if you felt that it were more appropriate now yes
oh well that s one of the natural occupational hazards of breathing is conflict with the law with police
i think that all people have to face that and accept it and do the best they can with it
that s if she had g other money back it d been bad on me because my story would ve blown up
have you seen any of the productions of requiem for a nun
noi have nt
i have read the version that camus did in french but then he turned it into an existentialist play but ive never seen it on the stage i would like to mr
faulkner eu lava rner seems to be the sort of character who would in some way seems almost larger than life seems to be invested with a meaning that s almost symbolic when you conceived this character did she seem to represent let us say some of the best aspects of the var ner s
oh you requite right
she was larger than life that she was an anachronism
she had no place there that that little little hamlet couldnt have held her and when she moved on to jefferson that couldnt hold her either but then that ll be in the next book the one that ll be out next month you requite right
she was larger than life
she was too big for this world mr
faulkner to what extent are your plots and characters preconceived or in other words to what extent do you outline what is going to happen to your characters before you begin to write
i dont at all
i get a character and and get him or her started get him or her involved with somebody else and then they take charge of it
i just gallop along behind to put it down but they are writing the book by that time you you have said previously that the sound and the fury came from an impression of a little girl up in a tree and i wondered how you built it from that and whether you just as you said let it let the story develop itself
well impressionist he wrong word
its more animage
a very moving image tome was of the children
of course we didnt know at that time that one was an idiot but there were three boys one was a girl and the girl was the only one that was brave enough to climb that tree to look in the forbidden window to see what was going on and that s what the book and it took the rest of the pages to explain why she was brave enough to climb the tree to look in the window
it was animage a picture tome a very moving one which was symbolized by the muddy bottom of her drawers as her brothers looked up into the apple tree that she had climbed to look in the window and the symbolism of the muddy bottom of the drawers became the lost caddy which had caused one brother to commit suicide and the other brother had had misused her money that shed sent back to the to the child the daughter
it was a i thought a short story something that could be done in about two pages a thousand words
i found out it couldnt
i finished it the first time and it wasnt rights oi wrote it again and that was quentin
that wasnt right
i wrote it again that was jason
that wasnt right
then i tried to let faulkner do it
that still was wrong mr
faulkner one thing that we sometimes seem to see with acquisitive people like the s nope ses is that after they have made the gains which they want very much to make respectability seems to set in and start to work on them too
do you see any signs of that happening in that clan
no only that the rapacious people if they re not careful they are seduced away and decide that what they ve got to have is respectability which destroys one almost anybody
that is nobody seems to be brave enough anymore to bean out and out blackguard or rascal that sooner or later he s got to be respectable and that finishes it why arent there blackguards then
they a in t brave and strong and tough like they used to be and that s why not
its the curse of the times maybe it maybe theresa three or four color printing of advertisements have been too seductive or a picture of a fine big car in two colors with a handsome young woman by it so that you almost think the woman comes with the new car when you make the starter payments
money is there s so much pressure to conform to be respectable more than in the victorian
i think so yes
in the victorian they tried to force you to be respectable to save your soul
now they compel you to be respectable to be rich were these people blackguards to save their souls
im not quite sure i understand the connection
well i think that possibly the old adam in man suggests to him to be a blackguard if he can getaway with it and when theresa great deal of pressure to be respectable if there is a great enough reward for the respectability he will choose that in preference to the pleasure of being a scoundrel and a blackguard that people dont have enough verve and zest anymore which is not the fault of manso much as the fault of the times that we live into where he there s too much pressure against being an individualist and and a good first rate scoundrel is an individualist
he dont really belong to a gang
once he s got to join a gang he becomes a second rate scoundrel but a first rate scoundrel is like a first rate artist he san individualist and the pressures all against being an individualist
you ve got to belong to a group
it dont matter much what group but you ve got to belong to it or there s no place for you in the culture or the economy
maybe to belong to a gang you might escape the atom bomb
this are you saying that he has to be a scoundrel to bean individualist
no sir
is aya scoundrel to be a good one must bean individualist
that only an individualist can be a first rate scoundrel
only an individualist can be a first rate artist
he cant belong to a group or a school and be a first rate writer
well until he was bitten by the bug to be respectable
then he let me down
i had an admiration for him until then
nono
he was he turned into a in his way a pretty good boy
he wanted no more of s nope s
he tried to remove himself from the aura and orbit of s nope s somebody once wrote i maybe this is apocryphal that a couple of s nope ses who have nt yet been described but who who might were to be described were named dollar watchs nope s and montgomery wards nope s
is there any truth to that
yes theresa montgomery wards s nope s
he went to france into keep from being drafted
he joined the ymca and he came back with a batch of of french pornographic postcards and opened what he called a studio
he he had a basque hat and a windsor tie by that time
he was an artist
his studio had a backdoor to it and if people joined the club they could look at the postcards until the government caught him
that was montgomery ward did he ever make it back to america
oh yes
this was back in jefferson where he opened his studio
you said before that it was your belief that man would prevail well in the light of this book the hamlet and several others that we ve discussed recently what type of man do you think will prevail
what kind
a scoundrel
nono
the scoundrel in time is seduced away by the desire to be respectable so he s finished
theresa what quality in man that prevails its its difficult to be specific about but somehow man does prevail
there s always someone that will will never stop trying to cope with s nope s that will never stop trying to get rid of s nope s
what
a remnant
no the impulse to eradicates nope s is in my opinion so strong that it it selects its champions when the cris comes when the battle comes it always produces a roland
it doesnt mean that they will get rid of s nope s or the impulse which produces s nope s but always there s something in man that dont likes nope s and objects to s nope s and if necessary will step into keeps nope s from doing some irreparable harm
there s whatever it is that keeps us still trying to paint the pictures to make the music to write the books
theresa great deal of pressure not to do that because certainly the artist has no place in in nature and almost no place at all in our american culture and economy but yet people still try to write books still try to paint pictures
they still goto a lot of trouble to produce the music and a few people will always goto hear the music which still has nothing to do with with the number of people that will produce the cadillac cars or the economy which will give everybody a chance to buy a cadillac caron the installment plan or the deep freezers
that is all that s advertised
it has to be advertised in order to keep you buying it but the books the music that s not advertised yet still there re people that will pay for it and buy the pictures
its a slow process but yet it apparently goes on that we will even outlast the atom and hydrogen bombs
i dont know right no who wwe will do it but my betis we will mr
faulkner there s another version of this story isnt there
it seems to mei remember one with a sewing machine agent telling it
im sure there is
i have written a dozen versions of it
i would i would have to see them all to unravel them myself but im sure there s any number of versions of it which is simply the craftsman s job to try it and try it and try it to have infinite patience to try and try and try until it comes as good as you can possibly make it
when you have reached that point it still a in t good enough so you write another one and you try and try that one to bring it to the nearest perfection that you are capable of which still wont be the best one so you write another one
when your each this point where you dont do that anymore you cut the throat mr
faulkner along this respectability scoundrel line how do you explain colonels ut pen who sweeps into jefferson and grimly sets himself up and along the line decide shell have respectability
marches into town with the willpower that s possibly equaled only by his mother his eventual mother in law
does he really lose his individuality or is respectability just another notch on his rifle so to speak
he wanted more than that
he wanted revenge as he saw it but also he wanted to establish the fact that man is immortal
that that man if heisman cannot be inferior to another man through artificial standards or circumstances
what he was trying to do when he was a boy he had gone to the front door of a big house and somebody a servant said go around to the backdoor
he said im going to be the one that lives in the big house
im going to establish a dynasty
i dont care how
and he violated all the rules of of decency and honor and pity and compassion and the fates took revenge on him
that s what that story was
but he was trying to say in his blundering way that why should a man be better than me because he s richer than me that if i had had the chance i might be just as good as he think she is so ill make myself as good as he think she is by getting the same outward trappings which he had which was a big house and servants in it
he didnt say i mim going to be be braver or more compassionate or more honest than he
he just said im going to be as rich as he was as big as he was on the outside
he never really attained this respectability
no he was the greeks destroyed him the old greek concept of tragedy
he wanted as on which symbolized this this ideal and he got too many sons
his sons destroyed one another and then him
he was left with the only son he had left was a negro mr
faulkner you ve said that you regarded respectability as one of the prime enemies of individualism
do you regard love as an enemy of individualism
no not at all
what s love got to do with respectability
no siri do not
respectability is an artificial standard which which comes from up here
that is respectability is not your concept or my concept
its what we think is jones s concept of respectability i dont mean to defend respectability in love or out
what i mean to do is be quiet please what i mean to ask is this
isnt there a basic dichotomy between the kind of individualism which you are praising and the attitude of love
if you will substitute decency for respectability i would agree with you
i dont quite follow you between respectability and love but decency and love
that san interesting point
has anybody else got a thought on that well that s what harry wilbour ne and the girl in wild palms discovered didnt they
that they couldnt get love and respectability together they couldnt live in the twentieth century patterns the way they wanted to
yes that s right but then by smiths conception of respectability they couldnt have had that anyway because one was already married
so there was a choice about will we take what we can or will we have a little or nothing and a little i think is always better than nothing
do you regard pylon a serious novel and what were you driving at in that novel
tome they were a fantastic and and bizarre phenomenon on the the face of a of a contemporary scene of our culture at a particular time
i wrote that book because id gotten in trouble with with ab salom ab salom and i had to getaway from it for a while so i thought a good way to getaway from it was to write another books oi wrote pylon
they were ep hemera and a phenomena on the face of a of a contemporary scene
that is there was really no place for them in in in the culture in the economy yet they were there at that time and everyone knew that they wouldnt last very long which it didnt
that time of those frantic little aeroplanes which dashed around the country and people wanting just enough money to live to get to the next place to race again something frenetic and in away almost immoral about it that they were outside outside the range of of god not only respectability of love but of but of god too that they had escaped the compulsion of of accepting a past and a future that they were they had no past
they were as as ephemeral as as the butterfly that s born this morning with no stomach and will will begone tomorrow which seemed tome interesting enough to make a story about
but that was just to getaway from a book that wasnt going too well until i could get back at it i think that perhaps we ve used up enough of mr faulkner s energy unless sir you feel the wish to carry on a bit more
surely
if anyone can suggest something we can discuss by all means
you might when should this stop
what do you well it has no set closing hour but but we dont want to tire you
well ive told you this is a dreadful habit to get into where you can stand up in front of people and talk and nobody can say shut up and s it down
audience laughter and applause to share with them our good fortune in having as writer in residence at the university of virginia the worlds greatest living novelist
he began our program last year by reading from his works but the question and answer period that followed was so lively and so prolonged that we thought that this year we would skip the appetizer and begin with the steak
mr william faulkner
any question
somebody must have atleast one
during our formal education we are are taught to adhere to certain grammatical rules punctuation rules sentence structure and so forth
do you think that if a writer attempts to adhere to such rules that his style is restricted or cramped in any sense
no sir
i dont think so
it maybe that his opportunities for experimentation are cramped
i think that any language must continue to be alive
that is it must continue to change or be susceptible to change and and grammar punctuation are are part of that fluidity
if by experimentation you you find out if the old ways were the best or maybe the old ways might be subject to change
i wouldnt say that it restricts your style because style could be apart of the fluidity of of the change
style if its a like anything else to be alive it must be in motion too
if it becomes fixed then its dead its just rhetoric
the style must change according to what the writer is trying to tell
what he is trying to tell in fact compels the style if im not speaking loud enough would you let me know
do you feel that the traditional values of the south have been endangered by increased industrialization
they couldnt be
the the values of anything to be of any importance must be alive too
it maybe that you wont like to see industrialization
you wont like to see the old customs change
but the only alternative to change is to cease to die
and i think that any culture that s worth its salt is going to cope with any change
that industrialization is not going to destroy anything of value in the south
the things of value which are are obsolete will be remembered and they will be the material for for writing for for art eventhough they no longer exist as a motivating quality in the present culture
they will exist as a well the jeweled casket to hold the fine traditions
in the sense that there s no such thing as was really that everyman is the sum of his past of his ancestry and so there s nothing ever ends in that sense
as long as somebody remembers it it still exists
the good of it will still exist still be available
this is a little bit more specific but is there any redemption within the s nope s family of itself will that come or is that going too far into your next novel
possibly
i think that in time evil will will exhaust its own tools
that is the s nope s will vanish
there will be some s nope ses named something else and its not really necessary to redeems nope ses
s nope ses are an infinitesimal part of the human race of man and man is i think pretty good
that he she s doing all right
that he can can take on a tribe of s nope ses and can get rid of them and they will not have done any great harm to the to the record of mans endeavor
that they are not really a problem
they area problem of the moment
and there s always someone that will will cope with s nope ses or will will outlasts nope ses
the the good the people that are against what s nope ses represent will last longer than the family of s nope ses will
what influenced your humor most
your did you read a lot of mark twain or something like that
that s a good question
that is its a question i mim happy to try to answer
i think that humor is not influenced by what anyone reads
it its an attitude of optimism toward mans predicament
that if you take mans predicament the dilemma too seriously that s not too good for anybody
but if you are capable of seeing that man with all his folly all the harm and the shoddiness he does that even in his a this worst he is capable of doing things in a comical way that he himself didnt intend to doi dont think you need to ape mark twain or or lea cock or any other humorist to write humor
its a point of view toward man in his dilemma which is tome a very healthy point of view
if you can can laugh at what man does then you you agree that what he does is not going to endure long enough to do a great deal of harm do you think that the southern attitude towards the negro is the same today as when you pictured it in your book intruder in the dust
no siri think it has changed
i think it has got to change because that was apart of a living culture and as i just said the only alternative to motion is death
so the culture the negros position in the southern culture will alter for the better
i believe that there are enough people in the south that realize that whether the negro is now capable of equality with the whiteman he will have to have the chance to try to find out simply because the negro is also a human being
and there s no position for a second class human being in a culture opposed to another antipathetic al culture as the world is today
you ve had a number of novels made into movies and i know you ve written some screenplays and i wonder if you think a novelist any novelist if one jeopardizes his position as a novelist by allowing hollywood sometimes to do a bad job
no sir not at all
i think the writer has done thebes the could thebes the possibly could with that book that nothing done to that book later can change it change what he did and the movies can take that book and if they want to if he wants to let them take that book for for any reason other than the belief that they re going to improve on it then they wont hurt it
if he s going to when the book is finished and it is done the way he wants it done then some movie picture company says if you ll rewrite this to please us then well give you money for it and he says all right i willi will rewrite this book before anybody i will destroy this book and write it to suit you then he has betrayed his own talent and his own trust whatever it is that the artist functions under
integrity call it what you like
but if he has finished the work done thebes the can with it then nothing can hurt it in my opinion
im interested in intruder in the dust too in the last part there that gavin you have the lawyer uncle in that say that it would be better if the north the outsiders left the south alone to settle its own problems and sins
do you still hold that theory or ami right in thinking that you meant that to start
i still hold that opinion i think that noone can be saved by an outsider
he must be saved from inside himself
that is the south must correct that evil as it applies to the south ourselves that it cant be done by bylaws or philosophical or political theories compelled onus from the outside well i was interested in what then should be the outsiders point of view from outside the south
in worrying about the south what if the south did not pull itself up by its own bootstraps
they would be worried about the effect upon the rest of the states
well in my opinion the south will have to pull itself up by its own bootstraps for the reason i just stated that the only alternative to motion progress is death
its a condition which we have realized much further back than was an impossible situation
our forefathers that fought the civil war knew that
mr jefferson knew that a hundred and fifty years ago
there were people even before mr jefferson that realized that slavery was an an impossible condition in this country that would have to be remedied
i think that the outsider who is doing it because he sado good er serves some purpose in keeping a certain pressure on but nobody knows when to let well enough alone and if he could just keep the constant faint pressure and let beat that he would serve his purpose but he gets too enthusiastic with changing overnight a condition which is emotional according to a pattern of morality which he cant dowell he might not be a do good er exactly
he he might be a person worried about the effect upon the country at large foreign policies or problems that come up out of traditional southern attitudes and then i wonder whether a senator from oregon for instance would suppose would do what position could he take that would be acceptable that would consist of certain rules and regulations to impose for the whole country
well of course he would do what he thought the people that elected him would expect him to do to get elected next time but he would still be working on a to compel a system of economic morality on an emotional condition heim not saying that he s wrong
im saying he s impractical speaking of the character of gavin stevens in the book did you have a real life figure that you based him on
i think a writer writes from three sources
one is his own personal experience which would include of course the books he reads has read his observation and his imagination
i doubt if he himself can say just how much of each source he has drawn from for this particular page or story or book
i believe though that he is convinced that he can create much better people than god can that he will never be satisfied to take anyone he has seen from real life put into a book because he would improve on it
i think that maybe a writer is incapable of actually sticking to the truth that he is a congenital liar and he is going to change alter anything that he he touches to put down on paper
so he himself cant say just how much of the character he actually saw how much he heard about how much he imagined
to him that s not too important
his what he wants to do is to create characters of his own yet are so close to life so lifelike that the people that read the books will say why yes that s that man could be so
in fact i know somebody a good deal like him
though actually the character that he put down is not what he ever saw
he s added something to it
what do you think of the thomas wolfe sort of writing in which something s are autobiographical and yet other things are just set in the background in personal observations
what do you think
i think that any writer is autobiographical in the sense that he is writing from those three reservoirs which i just spoke of that he is writing a man in terms of himself
that is he he is writing a man as he saw it
and i wouldnt know probably mr wolfe dont knowhow much he was writing of what he himself saw
he is writing mainly of what he himself believed he saw and heard and imagined that what he believed is truth as he knows it
but he would be even if he were writing his own life he probably couldnt stick to the truth
to what factors do you believe the success of your work has been what you hoped it would be
i have to ask you what you mean by success
popularity or the sale of the book perhaps
well i would id say that came from the fact that i have always kept myself an amateur
ive never thought of myself as a professional
ive done this for fun and it didnt really matter tome whether anybody read it or not
success is feminine and quite often if you if you began d pleads he scorns you
if you show the back your hand to her she clings to your knees but i think its because i have tried to bean amateur an dived one it just for fun not to get rich not to make money nor to be famous but because it was fun
it was something i found to do that was the most fun of anything id tried yet
in ever could quite do it and so id never be bored with it
that each time i finished a book it wasnt as good as i wanted it to be but i still had some more papers oid write another one tomorrow and maybe that one would be if any of you think of being writers that s the first advice i would give you is to keep it amateur do it for fun
its hard work i grant you but do it for fun because you like to do it
for example in pylon you touch on the city of new orleans where was that in away true to life you had your observations
that was a mixture of all three
that new orleans wasnt quite the new orleans i lived in at one time
that airport wasnt quite the airport that i have operated aircraft out of at various times
but just how much of it was true how much of it was lies i would have togo back over the book with a pencil and and postulate as i went along
but the writer is he is he is too busy
he is not interested in facts you see
he is interested in truth the fundamental truth of mans struggle within his predicament his dilemma
that he will will be as as strict as he can to the standards of integrity regarding the truth of of mans passions and hopes and fears and aspirations
but hell pay very little attention to physical facts
he wont care whether it is tuesday or tuesday
or whether new orleans is in louisiana or in oregon
it dont matter to him mr
faulkner
in the novel that novel pylon could the title could the title refer to the girl laverne the marker or beacon around which all the other all the men gravitate
now there s some more of this erudite professorial symbolism gets into everything
im sure that you requite right i just had nt thought of that i mim glad to know it
ill remember that
ill use that sometime probably
what about this matter of symbolism mr faulkner
are you ever conscious of some of the symbols you ve been accused of using
the writers like a carpenter
he has a a grab bag a barrel full of odds and ends of boards and nails and and the sort of things that he might possibly someday need and when he s busy in the heat of writing his story he needs something so he reaches back and scrabbles around in his barrel until he finds something that fits
of course the i think that one reads from the same background that the writer writes from
that is the culture
the culture contains this symbolism which has been established and described by the experts the psychiatrists and psychologists and since the one man writes from it another reads from it its natural that the symbolism should appear
and since the well in our case now we both read and write from a culture we call the culture of the christian culture and naturally symbols will be identifiable because they are part of the very air that both the writer and the reader have breathed through education and the experiences of being a child of being taught to be a christian child or the child of cultured parents
but i dont think the writer has got time to say now im going to write get a few symbols into this one
he s too busy
he s writing about people you see writing about human beings and the individual people in their struggles inside the human condition
he s trying to tell that story in the most dramatic way he can and when he realizes by instinct that a symbol will help him he reaches back in his carpenters catchall and gets out a symbol
but he s not deliberately writing symbols
you said you didnt deliberately write symbols but you are doing that i think and i would like to ask you if you saw the symbol in the bear in the short story the bear
since ive been up here and discussed it i see lots of symbolism that i was too busy at the time at the time the well the one symbol was the bear represented the the vanishing wilderness
the little dog that wasnt scared of the bear represented the indomitable spirit of man
ill have to have to dig back and getup some more of those symbols but i have learned around an even dozen that ive put into that story without knowing it but they are two pretty good ones that you can hold to
may i ask what you think of james joyce
james joyce was one of the great men of my time
he was electrocuted by the divine fire
he thomas mann were the great writers of my time
he was probably might have been the greatest but he was electrocuted
he had more talent than he could control
a great deal of attention in recent years has been devoted to the idea that perhaps mans life as he lives it from day today is speeded up rather tremendously and that this has had effects on his thinking im wondering first of all if you believe this is true and if you do believe its true if this has had an effect on what he wants toreador what he wants to be told
i dont believe it has had any effect on what he wants to read and what he wants to be told as its inside him
the effect has been on on what he has been told he wants to read
that s the pressure to conform to belong to groups to read the book of the month or to own the same cadillac or to have the same two children or to have a house that has everything in it that all the other houses on the street have
but basically he he he he is puzzled over the same fundamental problems that he has always been puzzled over ever since he found that he had a soul and stood up out of the mud
i think the others ephemeral and on the surface and and will pass away
that its nothing to be concerned about
theresa great deal of pressure on him to let somebody else decide for him what he shall read what he shall think what he shall do
but i dont think that will last
i dont think that he pays any attention to it actually
just what do you consider mans dilemma
i mean by that his situation
he wants to live in a world that s peaceful where he can have the simple things he wants and ye the she s always involved with overproduction in one place and under production in another and the threat of wars and atom bombs and he still instead of giving up he still tries to do something about that he still struggles within that dilemma to make it the one he wants in which all people can be happy in which little children wont have to suffer in which the weak would be protected
his dilemma is simply to make it work
theresa story s from the chinese i think at one time you may know this cats were the first form of life on earth
they had tried to make civilization work to get rid of wars and poverty and pestilence and it didnt work so they summoned all the wise cats to a congress and they said that we will choose some other form of life that is optimistic enough to believe that man can live in peace and plenty but foolish enough not to believe that he will fail again
so that s why the cat lives with you and he wont work and he dont love you
maybe that s why the cat looks at us the way he does
sir what do you think will aid the south in pulling our boot bootstraps up
education
better education than we ve got and do you think that education will up the people in time before
it well that s a good question
the the trouble is the south has got to be educated better in order to educate the inferior southerners regardless of what color they are
the problem now is of whether the inferior the uneducated southerner will wait that long anymore
but i dont know of anything better to dothan to alter our system of education so that the best can get the best of education
i dont know of anything else that will help us or save us
do you believe that do you feel optimistic about the enduring values in current american fiction by the younger writers say under forty five do you see any potential change in trends that will be of lasting literary value
i cant give a good answer because like my most writers as i get older i read less and less
its been along time since i have read my coevals
but im convinced that that is the strongest motivation in man is to create to produce literature music art
that s most enduring thing he has created and i think that nothing not even the atom bomb is going to stop him
i would say that now the young writer is subject to that same pressure to conform to belong to something which i spoke of
but i think that by the time he is thirty if he has a first rate talent he will have outgrown that
and im convinced that the good work will still be produced
its comforting for a lazy man to say well i would have been a good artist if id been born if i had nt been so unlucky as to be born in this time
i think that s nonsense that the goodman is going to produce no matter when he s born what age he is in that he will use that age as his material just as as apart of the reservoirs of observation and experience
and that he will produce the work too if he has the talent and works that nothing will stop him
and i used to think that it talent was important
i think maybe all he needs is ruthlessness industry and insight
that is to throwaway anything that seems to him untruthful or shoddy to work hard to be always curious as to know why man does what he does
i think that if the young writer has those three qualities he can write
im curious as to when why i wonder how the modern writer justifies using violence in his work
ive been struck by it and sometimes upset by it
i think that is one of the tools
that s a particular saw hammer that the particular carpenter feel she can do the most with that he might not like the violence either
its simply because he does not have a better tool to showman in his tragic or comic moments inside the predicament
that is the dramatic story is man is faced the frail fragile creature of flesh and bone mostly water in a ramshackle universe stuck together with electricity faced with problems which are usually bigger than he is
the story is does he face it
does it lick him
or does he beat it
or if it licks him does he get beaten to his knees still as hemingway says looking good
that i think is what anyone writes about
its man that is striving to be braver than he might be more honest than he might be to be compassionate and its so important in twentieth century more than in other centuries to write about this
well no its always been important
i think that s what makes man endure and what will cause him to endure that he is capable of wanting to be brave and to be honest and to be compassionate and he will last
he s outlasted his dinosaurs
hell outlast his atom bomb
my belief is that the last sound on earth when this earth is a red rock freezing will be two folks building an airship and fussing about where they re going next man is all right
you cant beat him
no there ll be three
the other one will be writing a book about it
when you begin to write a novel do you have it planned from beginning to end
not always
its its a little more instinctive than that
it could begin with a character
it could begin with an anecdote
and out of that the book grows in order to explain why the person got in that particular pro complexity
i some people work from plots but in ever could do it just like in ever did do any research
i its more fun tome to invent i think than to hunt up a fact but and this i wish it were as simple as that but its its not
you the writer i think never knows just where that germ came from that started him off
well in some of our writing classes at chapel hill we have well we ve been discussing with the ways you go about writing a novel and a short story
and and one of the theories we ve been dealing with is that a short story is planned outlined from beginning to end whereas in a novel it seems that most novelists tend to just find themselves as they go along
do you find that s true
i dont quite agree with that
if you mean by planned outlined into a pattern that s for short stories
yes and the novel you just kind of find the novel and yourself in it or noi think they both come from the same source
irate the ability to write in three degrees
the first degree the highest of course is the poet
he can say in say it in fourteen lines
irate next the short story writer
he can say it in ten pages
irate last the novelist because it takes him three or four hundred pages but it that s a matter of working
if you work from notes from something physical that you can look at in front of you then you work that way no matter what you rewriting
maybe the poet does if you plan it all inside before you put down anything then that s the way that you do it novel short story or sonnet
i dont think that could be a procedure a rule for procedure
actually the novelist wishes he could say it in ten pages
in fact all that any writer wants to do is to say it in one absolute word the poet the short story writer or the novelist
if he could state some moving tragic fundamental eternal truth of mans struggle within mans heart in one word that s what he wants to do
hell never do it and that s why he s never bored
he never touches s at i ation in his vocation
there s always some reason to getup tomorrow morning and rub your hands and go back to work mr
faulkner apropos of the last question asked s of aras i understood it and apropos of the first question asked i wonder if you would care to comment a little more broadly upon the effect of formal education on the creative writer
ihop eim not going to step on any toes now i dont believe that formal education ever made a writer or ever hurt him
i think a writer is omnivorous
he will use someday any experience
that formal education has taught him one very valuable quality which is mental discipline
he could teach himself mental discipline
he wouldnt have to have formal education for that
formal education simply simplifies his field of research
that he is offered by experts in in the simplest way knowledge which he probably very likely will need and will use
without formal education he would have to digit out himself
but i dont think that formal education could take a man and turn him into a writer
a few minutes ago you mentioned personal experience as one of the sources including that in books that you have read
according to that what is your opinion of such writers as stephen crane and dreiser and frank norris in relation to your own work
no writer is really interested in who wrote the book
he s interested only in the book
so i could probably find more influence of characters of cranes on what ive written than influence from crane himself that the only thing that s interesting to the writer is how someone else has taken man and from those three sources has created him in a slightly new or slightly awry awry light in his comic or tragic struggle within his own environment or his own dilemma
everything the writer has read from the telephone book up has influenced him
he s amoral omnivorous
he will rob and steal from any source because he is not only willing but if anyone after him robs and steals from him he s flattered
that means that he did it pretty well if somebody else wants to steal it
with all this talk of conformity particularly literary conformity dont you suppose that there s either less of it than talk of it has taken for granted or that its
would you ask me that again please ma amin other words dont you think there s less literary conformity than is constantly talked about
oh
well i dont think there s any such thing as literary conformity
the pressure to conform is not to be literary
its to belong to an economic strata
that liter a literature cant be conformed
the only restriction it submits to is that of language
and that s only in the terms of the reader
that no first rate writer is going to bother about writing like hemingway or like mark twain
he s too busy
he s writing about people
if anything any trick hemingway learned is good he will steal it from hemingway or from twain but he s not going to conform anybody s school of of literature
he s writing about people
and if he belongs to a school of literature its because they are pleasant folks to talk to and drink with until two and three o clock in the morning not to write like mr
faulkner speaking of language you said that the two great influences on the western world and writing are the bible and the greek myths and that the latter are dying out such as in terms that we speak of cultures or parts of cultures dying out and yet its feasible that a writer understands those myths and works with them
its a tenuous question but is it still legitimate for him to express himself in in an old outmoded form of language such as myths eventhough he s pretty sure that people who read him will not understand him atleast right away
if he feels that that is the best way for him to isolate man in the motion of being alive inside his dilemma yes by all means
he can use any any means any method he likes
but if he is going to write just to use means or method of style he s simply writing rhetoric and he would be better of fat something a little more fun than that
that the story itself compels its symbolism compels its its style i think that the writer as i said simply reaches behind him with one hand while he s writing with the other and drags out a symbol which he thinks is exactly the scrap of wood he needs to make that joint with which is in my opinion perfectly legitimate
if he is dealing simply with man in motion then he has obeyed all the compulsion of his craft on him
he can use whatever method he likes just as long as he sticks to the primary compulsion which is to deal with man in motion in a believable a credible dramatic way
not to judge simply to describe man struggling within his predicament in his unceasing conflict with himself with his fellows with his environment
any method he uses in my opinion is all right
you tellus in ab salom that miss rosa writes poetry an dive always been curious about what kind of poetry miss rosa
it would probably have been gothic love poetry fourth rate
mr faulkner what do you think of the dramatizations that have been made of your work for the movies and for the play coming out next year
is aw intruder in the dust i thought that was a pretty good picture it was a good deal like my book the others in ever saw
that play which will be in new york next next fall is the way i wrote it
that has nt been changed
that was sections of a book that was told in play form because that seemed tome the best way to tell the story of man struggling in his dilemma
so i used play form
the others i have nt seen because well id done the best i could with that book and i was interested in writing another one which would be better i thought and i just didnt have time togo to see it and then picture shows come at the wrong time of day forme its that s the time of day i like to beat home and have a drink or two and the neat supper and s it down and smoke and read for a while not togo out to the pictures how
yes m
you often talk about mans condition and mans dilemma and i hear people more poignant in the south
not hats simply because the writer to save time can write about what he knows best
then there s less chance of somebody saying u huh you re wrong
that folks dont do that in keokuk
the same for your ideas
yes i think that people are the same everywhere
their problems their immediate problems are different but their their struggle within within the fundamental simple human truths is the same everywhere i think
one writes about his own native land simply because that saves him having to do research to keep people from checking upon him that its its easier
it saves saves time
he s writing about something that s familiar that he has well you might say not only seen but smelled too
does that mean in a short story like dry september the situation is
yes
in which a a woman in that condition of frustration after menopause or about menopause could have caused that sort of tragedy
it wouldnt necessarily have to have a a colored note in it
not necessarily that same story but she could have caused that same grief injustice crime
pertinent to that id like to ask why is it that mississippi seems so very active in a literary way and yet we dont find the same phenomenon in new jersey
well that s that s because mississippi is in the south and new jerseys in the north i think i think that the wisest thing any nation can do when it gets itself into any sort of a economic muddle is to pick out some rich nation and declare war on it and get licked and then be supported
the folks in the south write because the north has supported us ever since we had plenty of time to write would you comment on this
it would seem tome in talking to other people about your work that the ladies in richmond this class southern ladies in general do not know your work as well as people in other parts of the country in europe
have you observed that
do you think that s true
i think that s because everybody in the south is writing
nobody has time to read anything
sir you speak of finishing a novel and then sitting down to write a better one
do you feel that your last book is whatever it is is the best that you ve done to date i mean
taken at anytime
no sir
i think to the writer there s no good better best
its got to be the best or its nothing
and none of them are good enough to suit me
i dont as i said the writer dont give a damn what anybody else thinks about this book yeah
it a in t good enough to suit meso im gonna write another one
and if i live another hundred years maybe ill do it
i probably wont but ill keep on trying
but the work is never suits the writer
that s why its the happiest of all vocations because you never touch s at i ation
you re never bored
there s something to getup to and goto work at tomorrow
ive been puzzling since asking my question
what did you mean when you said that joyce was electrocuted
only that he had a tremendous talent
he tried too hard to put the whole tragic history of mans struggle within his dilemma on the head of a pin
i think that is a feeling that every every writer every artist has that i will be here only for a very short time and this this tragic beautiful dilemma of mankind is so moving that i must put it down and i may not livelong enough to finish the book so ill try to do it in one sentence one word
joyce was trying to do it all in one english sentence which was ulysses and in one english word which was finnegans wake
do you feel that a good writer should necessarily be a region a list in the sense that he should write about those things that he knows best
he is writing about people and people in my opinion are not regional they are universal
they the same hopes aspirations tragedies are universal everywhere no matter what color nor what race
the writer is regional only in the sense that he is using something that he is familiar with to save himself the time of research
he is not trying to be a regional writer when he writes about the east tennessee mountains or about california
he is simply using the material that he is most familiar with to save himself the trouble of having to read up chamber of commerce brochures on portland oregon for instance
where did you first really get your get your interest in indians
was it from relics or living near them in mississippi or
that s apart of of my culture my north mississippi culture our country is compared to the country east of the mountains is was frontier only a hundred years ago
remnants of chickasaw families still live
they re still my neighbors
some are area remixed with negroes
others are mixed with white people
the traditions are still there
there in my childhood boyhood there were old men that could remember having heard their fathers tell them about the old days
the indian names are still on the creeks and branches the old roads the old hilltops still have the indian names with the tribal significance
work a certain number of hours at a time or do you wait for inspiration
i dont have to wait for inspiration if we can use that term
my trouble now is to keep from to find some good reason not to work
i dont like to work
i put it off as long as i can
when the demon begins to worry me and nag me too much then i wills it down and write
but in ever have used any system though some people do
just like ive never kept notes
i will put off the work of by any means i can think of
then when ive got to get it done i wills it down and write a batch of it so i can takeoff a week and not work im lazy
im sure that we all join in thanking you for being with us today
well thankyou ladies and gentlemen
ladies and gentlemen on behalf of the seminar committee may i welcome you to this twenty sixth washington and lee seminar in literature
the committee wishes me also to express our appreciation to the university of virginia for this gracious loan today of their most distinguished writer in residence
we are especially indebted to professors frederick gwynn and joseph blot ner who have accompanied him here
our speaker intends to read from his latest novel the town and at the conclusion of that he will welcome questions from you all
it would be presumptuous indeed forme to attempt any formal introduction of our speaker today but it is certainly my very great privilege to present to you mr william faulkner of oxford mississippi
iman amateur at this
i dont think i have a very good voice and if i dont speak loud enough would you please tell me
there is a ridge you drive on beyond seminary hill and in time you come upon it a mild unhurried farm road presently mounting to cross the ridge and on to join the main highway leading from jefferson to the world
and now looking back and down you see ally ok napa taw pha in the dying last of day beneath you
there are stars now just pricking out as you watch them among the others already coldly and softly burning the end of day is one vast green soundless murmur up the northwest toward the zenith yet it is as though light were not being subtracted from earth drained from earth backward and upward into that cooling green but rather had gathered pooling for a nun moving moment yet among the low places of the ground so that ground earth itself is luminous and only the dense clumps of trees are dark standing darkly and immobile out of it
then as though at signal the fireflies lightning bugs of the mississippi childs vernacular myriad and frenetic random and frantic pulsing not questing not qui ring but choir in gas if they were tiny incessant appease less voices cries words
and you stand suzerain and solitary above the whole sum of your life beneath the incessant ephemeral spangling
first is jefferson the center radiating weakly its puny glow into space beyond it enclosing it spreads the county tied by the diverging roads to that center as is the rim to the hubby its spokes yourself detached as god himself for this moment above the cradle of your nativity and of the men and women who made you the record and chronicle of your native land proffered for your perusal in ring by concentric ring like the ripples on living water above the dreamless slumber of your past you to preside un anguished and immune above this miniature of mans passions and hopes and disasters ambition and fear and lust and courage and abnegation and pity and honor and s in and pride all bound precarious and ramshackle held together by the web their on thin warp and woof of his rapacity but withal yet dedicated to his dreams
they are all here supine beneath you stratified and super posed os seo us and durable with the frail dust and the phantoms the rich alluvial river bottom land of old is set ib be ha the wild chickasaw king with his negro slaves and his sisters son called doom who murdered his way to the throne and legend said record itself said since there were old men in the county in my own childhood who had actually seen it stole an entire steamboat and had it dragged intact eleven miles overland to convert into a palace properly to ag grand is e his state the same fat black rich plantation earth still synonymous of the proud fading white plantation names whether wei mean of course they ever actually owned a plantation or not s ut pen and sartori s and comp son and edmonds and m cc asl in and beauchamp and grenier and haber sham and holston and stevens and de spain generals and governors and judges soldiers even if only cuban lieutenants and statesmen failed or not and simple politicians and overreach ers and just simple failures who snatched and grabbed and passed and vanished name and face and all
then the road less almost path less perpendicular hill country of mccallum and gowrie and frazier and muir translated intact with their pot stills and speaking only the old gaelic and not much of that from culloden to carolina then from carolina toyo kpa taw pha still intact and not speaking much of anything except now they called the pots kettles though the drink even i can remember this was still us que ba ugh then and last on to where frenchman s bend lay beyond the southeastern horizon cradle of var ner s and an the ap for the northeast crawl of s nope s
and you stand there you the oldman already white headed because it doesnt matter if they call your gray hairs premature because life itself is always premature which is why it aches and anguishes and pushing forty only a few years from forty while there rises up to you proffered up to you the spring darkness the un sleeping darkness which although it is of the dark itself declines the dark since dark is of the little death called sleeping
because look how eventhough the last of west is no longer green and all of firmament firmament is now one un lidded studded slow wheeling arc and the last of earth pooled visibility has drained away there still remains one faint diffusion since everywhere you look about the dark panorama you still see them faint as whispers the faint and shapeless lamb en ce of blooming dogwood returning loaned light to light as the phantoms of candles would
and you the oldman standing there while there rises to you about you suffocating you the spring dark people d and myriad two and two seeking never at all solitude but simply privacy the privacy decreed and created for them by the spring darkness the spring weather the spring which an american poet a fine one a woman and so she knows called girls weather and boys luck
which was not the first day at all not eden morning at all because girls weather and boys luck is the sum of all the days the cup the bowl proffered once to the lips in youth and then no more proffered to quench or sip or drain that lone one time and even that sometimes premature too soon
because the tragedy of life is it must be premature inconclusive and in con clu d able in order to be life it must be before itself in advance of itself to have been at all any questions please dont hesitate
are you working on a new novel at this time the the curse and the pleasure of being a writer is you never get done
you re always working at something
i think that s why its the best vocation of all because you never touch satiety
you re never bored there s always something to wake up for tomorrow morning
and so any writer is always working
he never finishes work
he wont live that long is the town the second part of a trilogy the third one will be called the the mansion
that will be the story of the family of s nope ses
that s the one im working at now what do you consider your best novel
i think that my feeling is the feeling that all writers have
none of them are quite good enough
they are they are failures
he has done thebes the can with it
it wasnt quite good enough to suit him
he doesnt care what anybody else thinks about it
its got to please himself and so he is going to write another one tomorrow
and he will keep on planning to write that other one tomorrow as long as he lives
so i have nt written the one that i think is good enough to suit me yeti think the only way that the writer can can measure can gauge his work is by the one that cost him the most anguish and trouble just as the parent has a tenderness for the afflicted child
the one that i think of with the most tenderness is the one that caused me the most trouble that is the most unsatisfactory because it it was trying to match what seemed tome the finest dream and it failed
when you say it doesnt satisfy what would be the ideal literary work in other words what would be the aim of a literary
the aim of course is unattainable which is why it will always bean aim
i think its to take to take man an instance of man in his struggle within his predicament to isolate it in the most moving instant which one can so that in that single work there will be the whole history of the human heart all the struggle and anguish of of of mans heart to be in one picture one piece of music one book
that s impossible to do
that s why the artist has is the luckiest of all occupations
he has something that he that s worth devoting his in his opinion his life to that he know she will never touch and will never be bored with
what american writers do you enjoy reading
i enjoy reading all of the mandi think all writers agree with me except faulkner well say i think that any writer must have an insatiable curiosity about people and fiction books are simply the records of man in the moments of his triumphs or disasters told by experts
for that reason i doubt if any writer has very much judgment about what he reads
he will read anything
as he gets older he will go back to certain books to certain characters as he would go into another town say twenty five miles away to spend an afternoon with an old friend
that to the writer it doesnt matter who wrote that books oic ant speak of books in terms of who wrote them but there are books that i will always like that i loved when i was twenty one years old that i will still go back to
could you say something about on the road kerouac
the sad thing about a writer as he get sold he reads less and less
the books that i read are the books i knew when i was twenty one years old unless someone says this is a good book
you will like it
read it
and so this book you speak of i haven tread yet
i intend to but i haven tread it yet
the only work of a young mani mat all familiar with is salinger
but i intend to and im ashamed that i have not read it yet but i will do that
i think that the pleasure in reading is inexhaustible too that one should read and one misses a great deal of pleasure simply because he is not familiar with the book
he has nt seen that book
also living as ido imai consider writing my hobby not my trade
im a farmer actually and the people i know are not literary people and i dont keep up with these books
sir have you read any of the elaborate critical analyses of your own works
no sir
i dont read that
i prefer to read fiction
siri d like to know what is your opinion of it
that in moving pictures long hot summer
i have nt seen that im not trying to be be funny about it
its simply because the writer has done thebes the can with his book
he works incomplete isolation and solitude
to make a moving picture or or a theater play cannot be done that way that is a communal business
the actor gives something to it
the director gives something to it
and whatever the moving picture does to that book it cant change what i did
it may it may improve it but what it improves its result will be something different from what i did
and that s one reason and i reckon the other reason is in my hometown the pictures how begins at seven o clock in the evening and that s the wrong time forme togo anywhere
that s when i like to beat home and have a drink or two and something to eat and then smoke for a while
would you care to comment on the writing you ve done while you were in hollywood
it was a pleasant way to make some money i did it mainly because i know a director
he raises and breeds horses and he has an airplane which he would let me fly when i needed one
he we hunt and fish together
and when he is making a picture and he gets in trouble with it and thinks i might be able to do something about i the sends forme
that s all the moving picture work ive done
its not my my cup of tea actually its for the reason ive stated that it is a matter of a lot of people working together when the writer has to get off into solitude and isolation to do the work
and in ever could well you might say take it seriously
even the money wasnt something to betaken seriously
it was too much for anybody raised in mississippi to see all at once
do you consider salinger to be one of our better writers
i was impressed with one book of his
it seemed tome that it showed a its not a fault its an evil that the writer has got to arm himself against which is the pressure of our culture to compel everyone to belong to something to a group
its difficult to bean individual in our culture
i think that what is a win in that book was a tragedy which in away represented salinger s own tragedy
there was a a young man intelligent a little more sensitive than most who simply wanted to love mankind and when he tried to break into mankind to love mankind man wasnt there
that tome was the tragedy of that book
that tome is the threat which all the young writers nowadays have got to be on guard against the pressure to relinquish submerge individuality theme into a mass of us
and i think that any first rate writing has been in terms of the individual who even in them oil and teem of the world was still me myself
he go this elbows skinned and his head bumped now and then but just with other heads and other elbows not with machinery
there was nothing in the teem and m oil of of the world to destroy his soulby compressing him into a relinquishment of the iam
do you think the novel
i would say it it would go through phases like any other form of life or motion
its got to be in motion
its got to change
the only alternative to change is stasis which is death
and it it will change yes
it may go into another medium
the novel may go into something visual into moving pictures
but the novel as a a quality will not change as long as as people are trying to record mans victories and defeats in terms of the recognizable human heart
lets say that as i put it the highest form of writing is the poem
the poet has taken that tragic beautiful moment of mans struggle within his dilemma and put it into fourteen lines
the second highest is the short story writer who has been able to do it in ten pages
the novelist is the failure
he s a failed poet
it took him three hundred pages to isolate that tragic beautiful moving dilemma victory or defeat of fragile invincible man in his dilemma
so the novel may change but its it will never vanish as a quality in culture
john steinbeck says that in america the writer is a little below the acrobat and a little above the sealand i wonder what you thought about that
noi dont rate the writer quite between the acrobat and the seal as steinbeck said
i think that the fact that the writer in this country is treated with a slightly cavalier treatment might be good for him because one thing that the writer must have in order to be a good writer is humility
he must not take himself too seriously
he must take what he is doing with complete seriousness but he must nt take what he does with very much seriousness
he must keep himself an amateur
and so that maybe pretty good for him
maybe if this country gave writers more kudos and more recognition then they d spend all their time walking around with their chests swelled up seeing who was looking at me now
but they wouldnt work
but i dont think i would rate you cant rate anyone dealing with something as intangible as as the human spirit its impossible to rate him unless you are going to look on his rating with the finance company he is buying his refrigerator or his car from
have you done any hunting and fishing
yes siri have done some quail shooting up near warrenton with some friends there and two days a goi went up into the blue ridge on mormons river after trout
i have been up the headwaters of the rapid an but i have not been in virginia in the fall enough to do much hunting sir when you are writing a book very broad scope
noi think the writer is writing primarily for himself
he really dont care a continental whether anybody else reads it or not that he has while while alive he has has seen man in with all his baseness his folly a fragile web of of bones and flesh mostly water in a ramshackle universe stuck together with electricity who and ye the has the faith to be braver than he think she can be to be more honorable than he think she can be
he has had pity and compassion when he didnt know he was going to do it
he has met problems bigger than himself and he has tried to solve them maybe he go this brains beaten out but he still tried
the artist is not trying to deliver a message
he is simply has been moved so by thin frail fragile man in his dilemma faced with things so much bigger and tougher and stronger than he yet still trying to do something to solve his problem
that its worth isolating in some tragic and moving moment to get down on paper
then he worries about if somebody else might read it
at the moment he simply has seen something so beautiful so moving so important to himself that he wants to put it down les the forget it
after that comes the thought somebody else might read this
in my own case i think i wrote for tenor fifteen years before it ever occurred tome that strangers might read it
the south has been for the last fifty years one of the most backward areas financially and in many other ways
the schools also are not considered by most people to be as good as in other areas
but yet your own state of mississippi and the south in general have produced most greater novelists i wonder if you care to comment on this
one reason is that there s so many folks in mississippi that can tread that they have to write i would say that s that s not true only in mississippi
id say that that s true almost throughout the what we think of as the south
i believe if i were a nation and i had struggled along and i wasnt doing too good that i would pick out some big rich country and declare war on them and let them lick me and then they d have to support me for the rest of my life and i think that maybe with the north having supported us since we ve had plenty of time to write
did you have a certain style that you would more or less
i dont like my style either
i think that what im trying to say is that i think that no writer has got time to bother too much about writing style or writing rhetoric if he does he has probably got very little to say that the story he stelling he is trying to isolate this moment of mans struggle in the most moving way he can
and he will try style
hell try metaphor
hell try symbolism to isolate that in the most moving way he can possibly do it
so the in my opinion the work itself creates its own style
that when its done the writer can look back and say this is clumsy
i wish i could think of a better way to do that
but he cant
he has done thebes the could with it
to get all he can into it
its well he has as we all do an awareness of death that he will not be here forever that the end can be for him tomorrow
he has been troubled and moved so much by what he s seen of mans struggle that he wants to get that on paper and he s afraid that if he puts it off he will die before he does it
he in effect is like the man that s trying to carve the lords prayer on the head of a pin
he s trying to put everything into one book one page the perfect thing would be to put all that history and anguish into one word which you cant do
and the fumbling with style with metaphor symbolism is simply his desperate frantic attempt to get the beauty he has seen by simply being alive down on paper before he before the lightning strikes
so he is he might that s why he could hate his style too but this was thebes the could do
that if he could do that over again he is convinced he could do it better
i think every writer believes that that if he could turn time back until this day last year that book would be a better book
of course it wouldnt bebu the believes that
he cant do it so he writes another book tomorrow
but he wants to be as lucid as pure as light or clearwater itself
and when it gets m oiled and turgid he is sorry
he grieves over that
though of course he dont have to read it anymore that s one advantage is writing a compulsion for you or could you stop if you decided to
well i would like to say sure i can take it or leave it but i dont believe that
i think that any writer is ridden by a demon that he really can the lp himself that he will keep on writing as long as he lives
but he he is not so conscious of being driven by a demon to no destination
he is convinced that he will will make the perfect work so that as long as men live after him they will see that work as perfect and will remember him that maybe what any artist is doing is simply writing k il roy was here on the wall of the last oblivion before he passes through it and beyond it
sir as a southerner andaman who writes about the south can you give us your views of the supreme court decision
audience murmur that s sort of got out of fiction has nt it i would say it was something that had to come
there was a the dean of the law school at the university of mississippi said ten twelve years ago that in time the supreme court would would hand down that opinion
nobody believed him its its our fault
if we had had given the negro a chance to find whether or no the can be equal there wouldnt have been any need for it
it has set relations between the races back for sometime but it had to come
its our fault
we could have prevented it
to create your characters
may i have the first part of that again
the writer is has got to be born with curiosity about people more than anything else
i thought at one time it took talent but now im not so sure
i think he has got to have ruthlessness to destroy what is not absolutely right in his opinion
he s got to have industry to do it over and over again
he s got to have curiosity and insight
curiosity and insight to wonder why man does what he does
i think that he he doesnt need experience personal experience to write about people
personal experience as far as mangoes can come from the books he reads
but certainly the writer takes from every experience of any s or the sever had
he he robs and steals from everything he s heard or seen or read
he s amoral but he s perfectly willing for anyone after him toro band steal from him
he has the three you might say reservoirs that what he writes comes from
one is that experience
one is observation
the other is imagination
and nobody s to say just how much comes from what
but the imagination can carry the load
there was one blind man who was a pretty good writer
you dont have to really experience nor even read
you can listen and the imagination
you said the writer is somewhat unappreciated amoral after a fashion and trying to capture a moment in the struggle of man but atleast im in some of your work a literary to say something more i think especially of the story the bear which i admire a great deal the trappings of that story trying to say something more im wondering whether despite the trappings if you feel this is basically a christian vision or a christian viewpoint that you represent
i cant say
i think the writer is too busy writing about man in his dilemma his predicament
of course he writes out of of the background the reservoir of his own culture and naturally in a christian and a southern culture the the symbolism of christianity and of the southern culture will appear
that is any any man is really writing he s still writing his own biography
he doesnt need to hunt around for for symbolism anymore than he needs to hunt around for a background from which to against which to see these imaginary people that he s trying to put down on paper
that was something that he inherited that he grew up with that came from his heredity and from his environment
but the writer himself is too busy telling about amazing incalculable marvelous man struggling within the dilemma of the human heart to bother too much about messages or symbols or when you begin to write one of your books have you already predetermined what is going to happen or do you makeup some of the details as you go along
it begins with a seed
that seed could be anecdote
it could be a situation
it could be a character
then you ve got to explain how that situation came to be
you ve got to explain where that character came from
and the first thing you know you ve got some more people in there explaining the situation and the character
then they all stand up and on their feet and begin to move and all you ve got to do is after that is to trot along behind them and put down what they do and say
that you can you can invent the finest most watertight plot you can think of
you get these people into it and if they are human unpredictable people they wont care a hoot about that plot
they ll go off and tell a story of their own
you can keep your plot
they dont want it
did you find ab salom ab salom
a very difficult novel to write
yes mit it was difficult
i worked on that next hardest to the sound and fury as i remember
yes i worked on that for a year and then put it away and wrote another book and then the story still wouldnt let meal one i came back to it
yes that was very difficult
there was a lot of rewriting in that
ive heard it reported that you ve said in the past that sanctuary was written as a potboiler do you care to comment on this
yes it was
i had had been writing as an amateur and having a lot of fun at it
then all of a sudden i found myself married and i would need a little money and i thought i might write something to make a little money with so i thought of the most horrific story i could and wrote it sent it into the publisher he said good lord man
this was nineteen in the nineteen twenties when you couldnt say the sort of things in books you can now
he said if we print this well both be in jail
so he put it away and i got a job and didnt need money too much
i wrote two more books which were printed and the none day i got the galley for sanctuary and i read it and it was so bad because it was basely conceived that i wrote him and said that well just burn this up and forget about it
he said well i have had plates stamped for it
i said well then ill rewrite it
he said that means that we have to make new plates
if you insist on rewriting and if you will dig up i will get the other and we will make new plates
so i paid my half of the new plates and rewrote the book to make it atleast honest
but i still dont like it because the whole conception was base
it did sell and was going to make me a lot of money
the publisher went bankrupt so i got just exactly what i deserved and i learned my lesson from it since then ive remained amateur
why did you go back to those same characters in requiem for a nun there was nothing wrong with the characters
the the conception of the first story was base because it was done not to tell about man in his tragic struggle but to make money
that s why it was base
but when i rewrote it id already invested
in those days i didnt have everyday
then i did the best i could to make an honest book out of it
and the characters there was nothing wrong with the characters just the concept of the book to begin with
sir in light of your friendship with sherwood anderson are you as a writer indebted to him
or what is your opinion of his place in american literature
his he has never been given his rightful place in american literature
in my opinion he s the father of of all of my generation hemingway erskine caldwell thomas wolfe dos passos
of course mark twain is all of our grandfather
but sherwood anderson has in my opinion has still to receive his rightful place in in american letters i know that this years nobelprize winner is a great admirer of yours and i wonder if you could what is your impression or thoughts of camus as a writer
if you re acquainted with him
yes i know camus best and i think highest of him
he is one man that has is doing what i have tried always to do which is to search demand ask always of of ones own soul
that is my reason for saying that he is the best of the living frenchmen better than sartre or the others
mal r aux was a he became obsessed with politics
but camus has stuck to his principles which was always to search the soul which i think is the writers first job
to search his own soul to give a proper moving picture of man in in the human dilemma
have you ever tried to write a novel in a northern atmosphere
noi have nt
i reckon is tick to mississippi because im too lazy to do research as long as is tick to what i know dialect habits customs folklore that i know then nobody can check me on them and say u huh you re wrong there
this is the way they do it in new hampshire
but people are are the same
there s too little difference
and i think when a manor woman writes about his own country he s not regional he s just too lazy to want to do any research
how have you enjoyed your stay here in virginia
and do you think virginia as an area is conducive as yo k napa taw pha county
well i have been in albemarle county off and on for two or three years now and i have seen a few s nope ses there but i like virginia and virginians
the longer i stay in albemarle county the more like mississippian s they behave but they dont have some of the mississippi vices
i have i said last year that i like virginians because they were snobs and since they seem to think i mall right then maybe iam all right
are the s nope ses really taking over jefferson and is there any group that might hold them out
the s nope ses will destroy themselves
i really cant afford to answer that question sir because you might not buy the next book if ido
they were that s the artists prerogative i think is to emphasize to underline to to blowup facts distort facts in order to state a truth
the there s probably no tribe of s nope ses in mississippi or anywhere else outside of my own apocrypha
they were simply an invention of mine to tell a story of man in his struggle
that i was not trying to say this is the sort of folks we raise in my part of mississippi at all
that they were simply overemphasized burlesqued if you like which is what mr dickens spent a lot of his time doing for a valid to him and tome reason which was to tell a story in a moving dramatic tragic or comical way
what is your opinion of henry miller
sorry i dont know him
should i you must believe me
ido live in the country and i dont keep up with literary things
iain ta literary man
so if i should know henry miller i will find out about it
along those lines do you think that the new american literature will develop what will it have to say or is there nothing left
it will have to say the same things that people have had to say and have been saying ever since man first found some way to paint pictures on the walls of the cave
its to tell about the eternal problems of mans heart which have nothing to do with atom bombs norn or labor unions nor the price of motorcars nor segregation nor integration
its man struggling with the eternal verities of of the soul
the young writer today as i said has got to resist that pressure to belong to groups to relinquish his capacity to think and judge into the mouth of a committee chairman
but he will write about the same passions and hopes and aspirations and griefs that people have written about ever since whoever wrote the old testament
his problem what to write about is there
he doesnt need
would you say that the s nope ses are capable or incapable of participating in
the ones which are incapable of it will will be obliterated the s nope s will evolve into you might say an acceptable type of s nope s
either that or hell have to vanish
that he will have to cope with his environment or his environment will destroy him
you keep referring to the tragic struggle siri wonder if you the artists chief talent is to in his ability to perceive this struggle or in his ability to put down the struggle once he s perceived it
to perceive it maybe to sympathize with it
not to judge it but simply to sympathize with it to pity it
if he perceives it and anguishes enough over i the will put it down
he may not be able to spell nor punctuate either but somebody in the publishers office will do that for him
he will put it down if he perceives it and anguishes over it hates it or admires it or is troubled by it then he will put it down
that will just take industry to work at it ruthlessness to throwaway what is not quite good to keep at it
sir you mentioned thomas wolfe as being of your generation would you comment on his place in american
its too soon to say i think
it takes takes a little time before the dross evaporates from anyone s work until theresa distance for a true perspective
at one time i was asked to what i thought of my contemporaries
i said its too soon to tell
the questioner said well have nt you got any opinion of them at all
i said opinion of who
he named wolfe hemingway dos passos caldwell and me
i rated them then wolfe first me second dos passos caldwell and hemingway not on on what wed accomplished but only on the single general ground i could find which was the attempt to do more than we could do on the failure i rated wolfe because his was the most splendid failure
he had tried hardest to take all the experience that he was capable of observing and imagining and put it down in one book on the head of a pin
he had the courage to experiment to be to write nonsense to be foolish to be sentimental in the attempt to get down the that single moving and passionate instance of mans struggle
i rated myself next because i had tried next hardest to get everything on one page
i rated the others down to hemingway not on the value of his work which i thought was perse the best because it was intact and complete
but his was showed less desire to try to get all of mans heart on to the pinhead
so i think its too soon for anyone to have a have an opinion about wolfe
maybe the only opinion to have about anybody is doi like to read him or dont i
and if i like to read him he s all right
if i dont like to read him then he maybe all right for somebody else but he a in t my cup of tea
i think we have we certainly owe mr faulkner our gratitude we certainly appreciate his good nature his stamina and i know we want to thank him for a really memorable occasion its with pleasure that i make this introduction today because its always a pleasure forme to introduce and for all of us to hear our speaker but its with regret too because this is our last session today
its our last session with the worlds greatest living novelist and with our own writer in residence who today will read from the book he has referred to as his favorite the sound and the fury
hell read from dil sey s section and at the conclusion of his reading he will answer such questions as you care to put to him
ill resist at this time all temptations to quote lines of poetry to say ave at que vale or anything of that sort because we hope to see him again and again in charlottesville in the years to come
mr william faulkner
since this is my last day here in my sojourn as writer in residence i could use this last hour to try to say thankyou to the people of albemarle county and charlottesville and the university for making my stay here this pleasant and this happy
i wont do that
i wont even say goodbye
every individual is the sum total of his past so when i leave here i will leave something of faulkner in albemarle county where faulkner was happy
when igo away i will take with me something of albemarle county
i will always comeback so that those two separates can be joined again
i wont need to say goodbye
and each time i comeback ill be saying much obliged
the road rose again to a scene like a painted backdrop notched into a cut of red clay crowned with oaks the road appeared to stop short off like a cut ribbon
beside it a weathered church lifted its crazy steeple like a painted church and the whole scene was as flat and without perspective as a painted cardboard setup on the ultimate edge of the flat earth against the windy sunlight of space and april and amid morning filled with bells
toward the church they thronged with slow sabbath deliberation the women and children went on in the men stopped outside and talked in quiet groups until the bell ceased ringing
then they too entered the church had been decorated with sparse flowers from kitchen gardens and hedgerows and with streamers of colored crepe paper
above the pulpit hung a battered christmas bell the accordion sort that collapses
the pulpit was empty though the choir was already in place fanning themselves although it was not warm
most of the women were gathered on one side of the room they were talking
then the bell struck one time and they dispersed to their seats and the congregations at for an instant expectant
the bell struck again one time
the choir rose and began to sing and the congregation turned its head as one as six small children four girls with tight pigtails bound with small scraps of cloth like butterflies and two boys with close napped heads entered and marched up the aisle strung together in a harness of white ribbons and flowers and followed by two men in single file
the second man was huge of a light coffee color imposing in a frock coat and white tie
his head was magisterial and profound his neck rolled above his collar in rich folds
but he was familiar to them and so the heads were still reverted when he had passed and it was not until the choir ceased singing that they realised that the visiting clergyman had already entered and when they saw the man who who had preceded their minister enter the pulpit still ahead of him an indescribable sound went up a sigh a sound of astonishment and disappointment
the visitor was undersized in a shabby alpaca coat
he had a wizened blackface like a small aged monkey
and all the while that the choir sang again and while the six children rose and sang in thin frightened tuneless whispers they watched the insignificant looking man sitting dwarfed and countrified by the ministers imposing bulk with something like consternation
they were still looking at him with consternation and unbelief when the minister rose and introduced him in rich rolling tones whose very unction served to increase increase the visitors insignificance
end ey brun gda tall de way fu m saint looe y fro ny whispered
ive kno weddel awd to use cui ser tools d end at dil sey said
hush now she said to ben
dey fix into sing again in a minute
when the visitor rose to speak he sounded like a whiteman
his voice was level and cold
it sounded too big to have come from him and they listened at first through with curiosity as they would have to a monkey talking
they began to watch him as they would a manon a tightrope
they even forgot his insignificant appearance in the virtuosity with which her an and poised and swooped upon the cold inflection less wire of his voice so that at last when with a sort of swooping glide he came to rest again beside the reading desk with one arm resting upon it at shoulder height and his monkey body as ref to fall motion as a mummy or an emptied vessel the congregation sighed as if it waked from a collective dream and moved a little in its seats
behind the pulpit the choir fanned steadily
dil sey whispered hush now
dey fix into singin a minute
then a voice said brethren
the preacher had not moved
his arm lay yet across the desk and he still held that pose while the voice died in sonorous echoes between the walls
it was as different as day and dark from his former tone with asad tim brou s quality like anal to horn sinking into their hearts and speaking there again when it had ceased in fading and cum u late echoes
brethren and sister en it said again the preacher removed his armand he began to walk back and forth before the desk his hands clasped behind him a meagre figure hunched over upon itself like that of one long immured in striving with the implacable earth i got there collection and the blood of the lamb
he tramped steadily back and forth beneath the twisted paper and the christmas bell hunched his hands clasped behind him
he was like a worn small rock w helm ed by the successive waves of his voice
with his body he seemed to feed that voice that succ u bus like had fleshed its teeth in him
and the congregation seemed to watch with its own eyes while the voice consumed him until he was nothing and they were nothing and there was not even a voice but instead their hearts were speaking to one another in chanting measures beyond the need for words so that when he came to rest again against the reading desk his monkey face lifted and his whole attitude that of a serene tortured crucifix that transcended its shabbiness and insignificance and made it of no moment along moaning expulsion of breath rose from them and a womans womans single soprano yes jesus
as the scudding day passed overhead the dingy windows glowed and faded in ghostly retrograde
a car passed along the road outside laboring in the s and died away
dil sey s at bolt upright her hand on ben s knee
two tears slid down her fallen cheeks in and out of the myriad corus cations of immolation and abnegation and time
brethren the minister said in a harsh whisper without moving
yes jesus
the womans voice said hushed yet

his voice rang again with the horns

any question from anyone mr
faulkner
do you think that theresa particular order in which your works should be read
many people have offered a sequence
do you think theresa particular sequence that your books should be read in
probably to begin with a book called sartori s
that has the germ of my apocrypha in it
a lot of the characters are postulated in that book
id say that s a good one to begin with is the present movie a compilation of various episodes in different novels
for in im thinking of the horse particularly did that come from the spotted horses that s so much like it
i dont know ma am because im not a moving picture goer
i have nt seen the movie i really dont know
my experience with moving pictures is that they have almost any reason for buying the book except to make it i remember mgm bought a book of mine called the un vanquished
they were stories of the civil war
i found out later that a producer named selznick had bought gone with the wind and he wanted to use clark gable in the picture but clark gable belonged to mgm and mgm wouldnt let mr selznick have clark gable unless mr selznick let mgm make the picture which mr selznick wouldnt do so mgm hunted around for another book to buy of the civil war to tell mr selznick they were going to make a gone with the wind themselves if he didnt let them make his so they bought my book with no intention of making it
i just wanted to ask you out of your answer during the previous year it came out that you dont take full responsibility for your characters
as if the created art with you was something unconscious not a willful act
i didnt make that statement clear
what i said was that im not responsible for the ideas and opinions that my characters express
i assume responsibility for the people but they have their own ideas and opinions that i dont always agree with
what is the reason that this book from which you read is your favorite novel
i think that no writer is ever quite satisfied with with the book
that s why he writes another one
that he is trying to put on paper something that is going to be a little better than anybody else has put on paper up to date and this is my favorite one because i worked the hardest on it not to accomplish what i hoped to do with it but i anguished and and raged over it more than over any other to try to make something out of it that it was impossible for forme to do its the same feeling that the parent may have toward the incorrigible or the abnormal child maybe has requiem for anu never been acted on the stage its been knocking around europe for the last six or seven years
it has been in every language until last fall it was three weeks at the court theater in london
it will be in in new york this fall
i have been trying to trace a tradition in your work and im curious to know whether you read sir walter scott to any extent in the time previous to writing your novels
yes mi did
i read everything i could get my hands on without any discretion or judgment at one time and im sure that everything ive read from the telephone book up has influenced what ive done since i think that s true of any writer
your books have been compared to bach s fugues
do you objectively plan out that they re going to have that effect or does it just come naturally
well its its not quite planned because probably iam not capable of that but i think that there s too much work goes into any book to call it a natural process but as about reading any experience the writer has ever suffered is going to influence what he does and that is not only what he s read but the music he s heard the pictures he s seen and it wasnt that i went to bach to get myself out of a ajam in the work but probably what i had heard of bach at the moment when i needed to use counterpoint there it was
how do you arrive at names for your characters
the only rule is to do the best you cannot to use the name of of any living person because you ll spend the next tenor fifteen dollars in stamps explaining that you didnt mean so and so
characters quite often name themselves just like the story itself will select its own title
some people tome look and behave just like their names
but that is i dont remember that i ever any trouble trying to get a name for a character
in ever had to look through city directories for names the the people themselves said im going to be named so and so
what is the immediate stimulus that makes you write
oh its a demon i dont know where it came from
i think every artist has got one do you think what im trying

do you do you think before you write or do you write well im glad you stopped there
thankyou didi think i know what you mean by the stimulus
its you re alive in the world
you seem an
you have an insatiable curiosity about him but more than that you have an admiration for him
he is frail and fragile a web of flesh and bone and mostly water
he s flung willy n illy into a ramshackle universe stuck together with electricity
the problems he faces are always a little bigger than he is and yet amazingly enough he copes with them not individually but but as a race
he endures
he s outlasted dinosaurs he s outlasted atom bombs
hell outlast communism
simply because there s some part in him that keeps him from ever knowing that he s whipped i suppose
that as frail as he is he he lives up to his codes of behavior
he shows compassion when there s no reason why he should he s braver than he should be
he s more honest
the writer is so interested he sees this as so amazing and and you might say so beautiful
anyway it its so moving to him that he wants to put it down on paper or in music or on canvas that he simply wants to isolate one of these instances in which man frail foolish man has acted miles above his head in some amusing or dramatic or tragic way
anyway some gallant way
that i suppose is the incentive to write apart from it being fun
i sort of believe that is the reason that people are artists
its its the most satisfying occupation man has discovered yet because you never can quite do it as well as you want to so there s always something to wake up tomorrow morning to do
you re never bored
you never reach s at i ation sir are there particular reasons why you do not goto the movies
they come at the wrong time of day that s the time of day i like to have two or three drinks and eats upper and then s it down and smoke and read
if the if they had moving pictures well i dont know id have something else better to do anytime of day i think maybe id rather read it than listen to it
id rather read shakespeare than see his plays would that apply to drama too i can count on my thumbs the plays ive seen in my life and that s one is ben hur
the other is was east lynne
i reckon i was eight nine years old
i remember ben hur because it had live horses in it and a camel
id never seen a camel before
are there things you can know about the world that scientists cant you as an artist
noi think that the sort of facts a scientist knows no artist is really interested in
that his interest is in the simple eternal fundamental truths of mans behavior not the facts of of his behavior nor the fact she lives among that the writer is has no concern with facts
he s a congenital liar to begin with
that s why they call it fiction
that he makes his own facts just to suit whatever phase of of the eternal truth he is trying to make dramatic have you ever been called a humorist
i think some of the things i write is funny i dont know sir how do you how do you organize your your novels
do you have any outline or do you just begin writing it
there s no rules for that
occasionally one is complete before you begin it which is tour de force but most of them begin with some incident in which man is acting in that gallant way despite his fragility others begin with a character who has in himself the seed of tragedy
after that the all the writer has to do is to run along behind with a notebook and put down what they say and do
they ve taken charge by then by then
why if you will agree that the writer is never quite satisfied with with anything he does then none of them are difficult or none of them are easy that emotion the emotion the character shows is simply one of the tools in the craftsman s toolbox and when he needs to show anger he can always steal from somebody else that has shown anger and copy it
if he believes in his characters enough and they themselves have stood upon their own hind legs and begun to move then all he has to do is just put down what they say and do that he doesnt have to create emotional states for them
they redoing that
he just is the stenographer
go back
im going to say the sentence structure is different in the later books than in the earlier ones
is that by intention or just an evolution in style
i prefer to think that no writer has got time to be too concerned with style that he is simply telling this dramatic instance in the most effective way he knows that the book the story creates its own style long and involved sentences i dont like the many anymore than the people that have to read them do but i couldnt think of any tome better more effective way to tell what i was trying to tell and its not really an evolution simply that one story in my opinion demanded compelled a certain diction and style
the story next to it has compelled a completely different one going back to the movies do you mind that they buy your movie and then treat it in an entirely different way from the way you would want it to be treated
well i wouldnt have any wants in the matter
i have done the best i could with that book myself
it wasnt quite as good as i thought it was going to be and im convinced that nobody can else improve on it and every now and then i like a little money myself and so they are welcome to do whatever they want to because they cant really think of that book as i wrote it
it occurs tome that as writer in residence we are making you look for backwards instead of forwards
we are making you analyze what you ve already done
has this affected your writing career
i think as long as the demons on my back nothing can affect my writing career
i think that it it pleases anyone to find that there are enough people who are moved or entertained by what he did to where they will will come in a group like this asking questions
it maybe that that s a poor habit for an an aged writer like me to form that he will get to where he d rather talk to folks than togo home and work in that way it may damage his work a little but i suspect that when the writers young and still ho the s not going to become writer in residence anyway
he s too busy that when he begins to scrape the bottom of the barrel then he can become a philosopher and as age but you would do you prefer to create a mood rather than a plot when writing
iam simply writing about people
i have taken man in one of his amazing victories and have tried to put it down on paper
if it takes plot to do that then i will will borrow a plot from somebody
there a in t but two or three plots you know if if it takes a mood then i will hunt around to where somebody s written the sort in memory i mean where somebody has portrayed that mood and i will borrow from him
then you are writing an emotion not
im writing about people
man involved in the human dilemma facing the problems bigger than he whether he licks them or whether they lick him but man as frail and fragile as he is ye the will keep on trying to be brave and honest and compassionate and that tome is very fine and very interesting and that is the reason i think any writer writes
he s not trying to write style
he s not trying to uplift to deliver a message
he is simply writing about a man in the infinite mutations of of mans capacity
i dont know that book
i read a story that was inside the story of of a man named cass something that was the best part of that book
as far a sim concerned he can throw the rest of the book away but that is a very fine story
so i cant speak about that book
i didnt read it with with enough attention to remember it only that story of the man cass i believe
do the critics bother you in anyway or change the tenor or direction of your thinking or actions
i dont read critics
id rather read imaginary fiction im not adr bowers i think you say stated or one of you gentlemen stated that mr faulkner didnt particularly care to discuss literature at anytime in more or less of a social atmosphere
what was his favorite topic of discussion at that time dr
bowers you mentioned that you pointed out that mr faulkner was a little hesitant in speaking before audiences
was he by nature as hyman or did he ever give any explanation for not appearing to want to appear before audiences the breadth of some of his interest i think is could be shown by his conversations with mr col vert about airplanes
i just want to throw in a special question you might want to ask because i think its unusual ask what he talked to you about yeah
what did he used to talk to you about did he keep up with modern day aircraft at all
i mean did he discuss this with you what was his feeling about the community of charlottesville in itself s to s to vall did he ever express specifically a philosophy of life mr
faulkner will answer questions
we will have a number of them on was preferably
sir a fy ce plays a minor part in was and in a few more of your stories i believe
well is a fy ce just a mongrel or is he an out of the ordinary mongrel that you might equate with the primitive
he is in our mississippi jargon he is any small dog usually he was a fox or rat terrier at one time that has gotten mixed up with hound with bird dog everything else but any small dog in my country is called a fy ce can we lookup on him as representing the primitive such as the bear and the forest
no he s the in away the the antithesis of the bear
the bear represented the obsolete primitive
the fy ce represents the creature who has coped with environment and is still on top of it you might say
that he has instead of sticking to his breeding and and becoming a decadent degenerate creature he has mixed himself up with the good stock where he picked and chose
and he s quite smart he s quite brave
all s against him is his size
but in ever knew a fy ce yet that realized that he wasnt as big as anything else he ever saw even a bear
yes sir
into what strata would these people fit mr hubert and miss soph on sib a
they were the aristocracy of provincial mississippi at that time
it was still frontier
in nat che z they had the fine empire furniture
people had they spent their money on ob jets dart from europe furnishings and fine clothes
in in the country these people they were aristocracy but they were still frontier they were still the tall man with the long rifle in away
that even their splendor was a little on the slovenly side that they went through the motions of of living like dukes and princes but their life wasnt too different from the man who lived in a mud floored hovel no they represented the aristocracy they were the wealthy the men of power the owners of slaves
could you explain the significance of the title was
yes i was this was the first chapter in a book
the book was composed of short stories
it covered a great deal of time
the central character in the book was a man named is acm cc asl in who was old at the time of the book
but this background which produced is acm cc asl in had to be told by somebody and so this is is acm cc as lins uncle this cass here is not old ike this is ike s uncle
and was simply because ike is saying to the reader im not telling this this was my uncle my great uncle that told it
that s the only reason for was that this was the old time
but its part of him too
sir does the presentation of the ribbon to uncle buddy have any significance from medieval tales or anything
yes that was miss soph on sib a with that belief of her s and her brother too that they were the rightful heirs to to die for his choice
sir do you look at your humor as a with the same inspiration as you do a serious thing or is it more a relaxing kind of work
nono its apart of man too its apart of life
that people are there s not too fine a distinction between humor and tragedy that even tragedy is in away walking a tightrope between the ridiculous between the bizarre and the and the terrible
that its possibly the writer uses humor as a tool that he s still trying to write about people to write about man about the human heart in some moving way and so he uses whatever tool that he thinks will do most to finish the picture which at the moment he is he is trying to paint of man
that he will use humor tragedy just as he uses violence
they are tools but a nine radi cable part of life humor is
yes sir what is the significance of the title red leaves
well that was probably symbolism
the the red leaves referred to the indian
it was the decidua tion of nature which noone could stop that had suffocated smothered destroyed the negro
that the red leaves had nothing against him when they suffocated and destroyed him
they had nothing against him they probably liked him but it was normal decidua tion which the red leaves whether they regretted it or not had nothing more to say in
yes sir sir you use hunting terms all through was when they re chasing to mey st url
is there any significance to this i mean do they think that perhaps this colored man is not about well say he son the same plane as the fox
at that at that time he was at the very time that these twin brothers had believed that there was something outrageous and wrong in slavery and they had done what they could
in fact they had had given up their fathers fine mansion to let the slaves live in it and they had built a two room log cabin that they lived in that they by instinct knew that slavery was wrong but they didnt know quite what to do about it
and in the heat of of the pursuit of well in in in daily life they would use the terms in which the negro was on a level with the dog or the animal they ran
and especially in the heat of a race which though though this was more of of deadly purpose than simple pleasure in the heat of running running this man the man became quarry that would have received the same respect that the bear or the deer would that is the bear or the deer would have his chance for his life
they wouldnt have betrayed him tricked him they wouldnt have built a dead fall for him
they would have run him all fair with the dogs and if he could escape could kill the dogs and getaway good for him
if he couldnt it was too bad sir never having been fox hunting what do you mean by going to earth as far as to mey st url was concerned
that s when the quarry finds a hole in the ground aden and runs into it
the fox before the dogs he will try first to trick the dogs and if he cant then he gets into something that the dogs cant follow him into
he goes finds an old fox den or something that he knows that the dog is too big to follow he gets in there he s gone to earth
sir did to mey st url stack the deck
and if so oh yes because he wanted ten nie and he wanted togo back home and take ten nie with him well i understood that in the last thing it says that if he if mr
hubert didnt call uncle buddy then everything would stay just the way it was and that to mey st url would go back with uncle buddy and uncle buck and that ten nie would stay with mr hubert and leave it just the way it was before
nono if uncle buddy saved uncle buck from miss soph on sib a then uncle buddy would have to buy ten nie
that was the way the bet was settled and so to mey st url he didnt care whether uncle buck was safe from miss soph on sib a or not but he wanted ten nieto go back home with him and so he he hunted around found that last deuce for uncle buddy
he was playing for ten nie
uncle buddy was playing for his brother to save his brother
their aims were the same though the end was slightly different
sir in another one of your stories percy grimm do you think that the type of person that is exemplified there is prevalent in the south today perhaps in the white citizens councils
i wouldnt say prevalent
he exists everywhere
i wrote that book in before id ever heard of hitler s stormtroopers what he was was a nazi storm trooper but the nid never heard of one then and he s not prevalent but he s everywhere
i wouldnt say that there are more of him in the south but i would say that there are probably more of him in the white citizens council than anywhere else in the south but i think you find him everywhere in all countries in all people
sir was percy grimm ever punished for his crime
i think in time that every storm trooper suffers for it
he dont suffer any retribution any stroke of lightning from the gods but he s got to live with himself and there comes a time when you ve got to live with that when you re too old and the the fire which enables you to get a certain amount of hysterical adrenal ic pleasure out of things like that is gone and and all you have left is to remember what you did and you probably wonder why in gods name you did things like that and you have to live with it
and i think that quite often unexplained suicides go back to some man who has done something like that and he get sold and he s got to live with it and decides its not worth living with it
you spoke a little while ago of greek themes
i was wondering if you think that modern literature or twentieth century literature so to speak could feature the truly tragic hero that you would find in greek times or do you think the characters should be meaner or more simple
that s a difficult question to answer
i think the writer has got to write in terms of his environment and his environment consists not only in in the immediate scene but his readers are part of that environment too and maybe nobody can can write forever without expecting to be read and probably a writer whether he intends to or not or knows it or not is going to shape what he writes in in the terms of of who will read it
so so maybe when there are fine listeners there will be fine poets again that maybe the writing that is not too good is not just the writers fault it maybe because of the environment apart of which is the general ef flu vi um of of the readers the people who will read it that does something to the air they all breathe together that compels the shape of the book
it would be fine if people could write in in the old simple clear hellenic tradition but then maybe that would be now obsolete that there was a time for that the time for that is not now it may comeback if life does go in cycles
sir in your excerpt from the un vanquished an odor of verbena why is that sprig of verbena left on bayard s pillow right at the very end when she leaves she says she s going to abjure verbena forever and ever and then he goes off he walks into town and he meets mr redmond i believe it is and then without any gun or anything and then comes back and the sprig of verbena is left on his pillow
that of of course the verbena was associated with drusilla with that woman and she had wanted him to take a pistol and and avenge his fathers death
he he went to the man who had shot his father unarmed and instead of killing the man by that gesture he drove the man out of town and although that had had violated drusilla s traditions of an eye for an eyes he the spring of verbena meant that she realized that that took courage too and maybe more moral courage than to have drawn blood or to have taken another step in an endless feud of an eye for an eye but then why did she leave
because she was at that time too old she was still too involved in it to accept that morally
i mean accept it physically that her husband had not been been avenged by his owns on
that is her intellect said said this was a brave thing but the eve in her said my husband my lover has not been avenged
and she could say you were brave but she this is not forme that i that sort of bravery is not forme
sir is there any reason for the southern the blossoming of southern writing that is are there any circumstances in the southern environment that would bring about the blossoming of great writers as it has
i dont know
that s a literary question and i wouldnt undertake to answer it
i might say that when that so called blossoming of southern writers came along it was at a time when nobody in the south had much money they couldnt travel and they had to invent a world a little different from the shabby one they lived in so they took to writing which is cheaper than a that is are am of paper and a pencil is cheaper than a railroad ticket
sir why in the beginning of your book about you mention ikk emo tub be why does ikk emo tub be cease to own the land as soon as he realizes that it is saleable and do the people like the comp sons who have bought the land do they ever belong to the land in the sense that ikk emo tub be previously had
noi dont think they do
i think the ghost of of that ravishment lingers in the land that the landis inimical to the whiteman because of the unjust way in which it was taken from ikk emo tub be and his people
that happened by treaty which president jackson established with the chickasaw s and the choctaw s in which they would take land in oklahoma in exchange for their mississippi land
and they were paid for it but they were compelled to leave it either to leave on to follow a chimera in the west or to stay there in a condition even worse than the negro slave in isolation
there area few of them still in mississippi but they fair a good deal like animals in a zoo they have nono place in the culture in the economy unless they become white men and they have in some cases mixed with white people and their own conditions have vanished or they have mixed with negroes and they have descended into the negroes condition of semi peonage and even the aristocracy the original aristocracy was tainted
they never owned the land
the land was never their s
that s right
they the indians held the land communally a few of them that were wise enough to see which way the wind was blowing would get government patents for the land
there was one of them a choctaw chief was one of the wealthiest men in mississippi greenwood le flore he was wise enough to get a patented deed to his land and to take up the whiteman sways
he was a cotton planter
he built a tremendous mansion and imported the furnishings from france and he was quite wealthy
and then when in he declined to accept the confederacy and confederate troops were sent in there and his his stables were seton fire the story is that when when they demanded that he accept an oath to the confederacy he went into the house and got a united states flag and wrapped it around himself and and came out and walked into that burning barn and died there but that s we dont know whether that s so or not but that s the legend
but the house is still there
its a museum now and and his descendants they are two great great nieces
they re mostly white now
they own the place i want to thankyou on behalf of me and the class members
we meet in this room on monday and wednesday
thankyou
this question is about light in august
could you tell me your purpose in placing the chapter about high towers early life in the end of the novel rather than when high tower first appeared
it maybe this
unless a book follows a simple direct line such as a story of of adventure it becomes a series of pieces
its a good deal like like dressing a showcase window
it takes a certain amount of of judgment and and taste to arrange the different pieces in the most effective place in juxtaposition to one another
that was the reason
it seemed tome that was the most effective place to put that to underline the tragedy of christmas s story by the tragedy of of his antithesis
a man who high tower was a man who who wanted to be better than he was afraid he would
he had failed his wife
here was another chance he had and he failed his christian oath a saman of god and he escaped into his past where some member of his family was brave enough to match the moment but it was put at that point in the book i think because i thought that was the most effective place for it
sir do you find it easier to create a female character in literature or a male character
its much more fun to try to write about women because i think women are marvelous
they re wonderful and i know very little about them and so i its much more fun to try to write about women than about men
more difficult yes
sir in delta autumn in a the thoughts of ike m cc asl in when he stalking to the colored girl you write maybe in a thousand or two thousand years in america but not now not now
i was i was wondering how you might apply that to the present day conditions that have happened since the writing of the story with the supreme court decision and what not
he used a thousand or two thousand years in his despair
he had seen a condition which was intolerable which shouldnt be but it was and he was saying in effect that this this must be changed
this cannot goon but im too old to do anything about it that maybe in a thousand years somebody will be young enough and strong enough to do something about it that was that was all he meant by the numbers but i think that he s a was as everybody that thinks that a condition like that is intolerable not so much intolerable to mans sense of justice but maybe intolerable to a condition to the condition that any country has reached the point where if it is to endure it must have no inner conflicts based on a wrong a basic human wrong
in your your story arose arose for emily was she drawn from a from a real person real character or is she made up out of your mind
nono i think a writer uses observation experience imagination
he never knows just how much of which he does use but i dont believe you can write a very good or very moving story about a human being in the the proscribed limits of of a story or a book and take a human being from life
it takes sixty years to create a complete and rounded human being but the writer has nt got that much time
he s only got thirty minutes or at the best three or four hours and so probably any writer is has made a composite picture
its its people he knew or things he imagined things he read things he heard but he wouldnt bother with trying to reduce to paper or to put on to paper any living creature
also theresa quality of of godlike omnipotence that the fury of of creating something gives you and you re not satisfied with the way god did it you can improve on him just a little
sir in was can you tellus how uncle buck successfully foiled an attempt by mr hubert beauchamp to get him to marry soph on sib a
well eventually they do get married and i wonder if you could give us any idea as to how she eventually caught him
oh i think that women are much stronger much more determined than men and just because the semen had wasted an evening over a deck of cards that had nt changed miss soph on sib as intentions at all
and probably uncle buck finally just gave up
that was his fate and he he might just as well quit struggling
sir can you tellus where s ut pen acquired his money in wedding in the rain when he came back and he first he came back with the architect and all his the negroes or sort of creatures that he had and built his house and later on came back with the furnishings
he very likely looted his caribbean father in laws plantation when he married the daughter
i dont know that i ever decided myself just how he did it but very likely he looted and wrecked wrecked the whole place took took the girl because he didnt want her especially
he wanted as on
he wanted to establish his dynasty
and i imagine that he he got that money to the states and then had to hide i there and there
there were no banks in those days no safe place to put it
probably was gold something that was intrinsic of itself and he would go off wherever he had buried it and dig up a little more when he needed it
sir in your story the bear why did boon kills am fathers
because sam asked him to
sam s life had finished then
he was an oldman
he was sick and and sam at that point represented his whole race
the whiteman had dispossessed the whole race
they had nothing left and sam was old
he was weak and sick
that was the greek conception and sam knew that boon and this little boy who was too young to have used the knife or whatever it was would defends ams right to die and would approve of the fact that boon the instrument was willing to kills am
but sam was done with life and he wanted that done and and boon was the servant that did it
sir in arose for emily is it possible to take homer barron and emily and sort of show that one represents the south and the north
was there was there anything on your part there trying to show the north and the south in sort of a battle maybe miss emily representing the south coming out victorious in the odd way that she did
that would be only incidental
i think that the writer is too busy trying to create flesh and blood people that will stand up and casta shadow to have time to be conscious of of all the symbolism that he may put into what he does or what people may read into it that if he had time to that is if one individual could could write the authentic credible flesh and blood character and at the sametime deliver the message maybe he would but i dont believe any writer is capable of doing both that he s got to choose one of the two
either he is delivering a message or he s trying to create flesh and blood living suffering anguishing human beings
and as any man works out of his past since any mann oman is himself he s a sum of his past and in away if you can accept the term of his future too
and this struggle between the south and the north could have been apart of my background my experience without me knowing it
sir why is it in death drag jock left captain despite captain warrens plea to stay there or to accept the raincoat or to accept any sort of job
was there anything besides pride that made him leave fly off in that old crate
yes it was well pride was about what it was the its of course it is probably true of all all flying people but ido know that the flying people out of that war most of them would ve been better off if they had died on the eleventh of november that few of them were any good to try to take up the burden of peace and this this man was lost and doomed of course warren was different
he had managed to cope with with but this other man would never cope with
he was hopeless
he was doomed
sir in your novels you said in one of the other classes that you begin with a character in mind or more than one character
in your short stories do they do you conceive of them in the same way or do you start with a person or do you
sometimes with a person sometimes with an anecdote
but the short story is conceived in the same terms that the book is the the first job the craftsman faces is to tell this as quickly and as simply as i can
and if he s good if he s of of the first order like chekhov he can do it everytime in two or three thousand words but if he s not that good sometimes it takes him eighty thousand words
but they are are similar and he is simply trying to tell something which was true and moving in the shortest time he can and then if he has sense enough stop
that is i dont believe the manor the womans its down and says now im going to write a short story or now im going to write a novel
its an idea that begins with the with the thought the image of a character or of an anecdote and even in the same breath almost like lightning it it begins to take a shape that he can see whether its going to be a short story or a novel
sometimes not always
sometimes he thinks it ll be a short story and finds that he cant
sometimes it looks like its to be a novel and then after he works on i the sees that its not that he can tell it in two thousand or five thousands words
no rule to it
sir is it true that you dont read your critics
yes that s right
could you elaborate on that
well when the work is finished and it dont suit mean dim the one that s got to be suited and that one didnt so by that time im busy working on another one and i just dont get around to reading the critics because that tome is water under the bridge
you see there s nothing more i can do to it
and he cant do anything to it either
do you ever read your own work over again after a lapse of say not hats the nice thing about writing
that s always one book you wont have to read no matter how long it is
do you have any trouble remembering say a short story you might ve written in or something like that
i remember the people but i cant remember what story they are in nor always what they did
i have togo back and look at it to unravel what the person was doing
i remember the character though
when you read do you frequently find that you get so many ideas after reading a few pages that you find yourself more willing and interested in beginning to write something or continue to read
that is do you think writers find difficulty in reading
well i mim convinced that the writer never stops working that even when he s reading he he is not deliberately looking for for ideas or what we might say call inspiration but he never knows just when from from what page what paragraph in what book something might strike him
he s got to put that book down and get a piece of paper and write im convinced of that mr
faulkner yes when you think of a short story or a novel taking shape in your mind and you know which form its to take how much of a pattern do you have in mind as it takes shape before you get it down on paper
not always too much
if you if its all complete the form and the pattern too then its a tour de force
that s just a matter of sitting down and swatting it out but if its an idea and then begins to take a tremendous and nebulous almost formless shape then the book itself commands its its progress that the book itself takes charge and does a certain amount of selecting
i think that you think of of any number of of things actions that the characters might perform and what they might say that there s no place in the story that you retelling for
they sound fine to you but there just a in t anyplace in that story that the book itself has taken charge says no nowe dont want that
well have this one
when writing a novel or a short story do you get obsessed with your thoughts and do you write constantly for hours on end or do you more or less look at it objectively
well its its fun to do and the tendency is to overdo it just like you reina game something you like that you your judgment would say you d better stop now you re getting tired you re not not doing too well but its still fun and you keep on
ive made i tried to make one rule to stop while its still hot that is to leave it while im looking good as gentlemen prefer blondes says do you ever jump up in the middle of the night and write something down
oh yes
yes lots of times
ive never had any any order
i have heard of people that can set aside so many hours a day and or to write so many words a day but that has never been forme
i write when it shot then i quit and rest and then i get at it again sometimes fourteen or sixteen hours a day and then sometimes i wont write a word for fourteen or sixteen days
sir in intruder in the dust i believe you say that integration in the south could only be accomplished by the south itself through some external means of triggering you might say
i think you used the expression a snowball starting an avalanche
yes well exactly how far do you think this is going right now this snowball
it was going along too slowly i mean not too slowly for the white people in the south but too slowly for for the negro
but it was moving
it it was actually in motion
the last two or three years it has stopped and and in ways has retrograded
there was a little too much pressure from outside
but there are are people in the south that more than than just just me that recognize the situation as being intolerable not from a humanitarian point of view but from a practical point of view that a country cannot endure with a minority as big as seventeen million people second rate citizens
it just faced with the with the trouble that we face in the world that s that s bad bad business and you think that this triggering effect lasted too long that it should ve been ceased sooner
well it the push carried on too long
if the red been a nudge and then stop and let the ball move of its own weight
but success goes to anyone s head and it creates its own illusion and the people who had felt that things were going too slow that that s anything that slow was not progress it was difficult to tell them to stop
you couldnt expect them to stop
that that has has done harm but i think that will not really delay equality for the negro
it will cause a great deal of of trouble and anguish and individuals will suffer but i think the course of of the negros advancement in the south has nt been hurt by this
i dont think its been helped very much by it except that somebody somewhere has got to nudge us now and then that we do go too slow if its left to ourselves
people are too prone to say oh well things are all right
like the sign in the pullman car that says quiet is requested for the sake of those who have already retired
that sort of thing you know
siri understand with sanctuary you ve said that it was written for the sensational value of it
would you say now for a young writer who might be trying to break into it do you think that he should devote his time and talents if any towards a sensational type of work or do you think that he should try and write more or less from the soul you might say or write as he as he feels rather than what he feels might be accepted
i would say if he is creating characters which are flesh and blood people are believable and are honest and true then he can use sensationalism if he thinks that san effective way to tell his story
but if he s writing just for sensationalism then he has betrayed the his vocation and he deserves to suffer from it
that is sensationalism is in away an incidental tool that he might use sensationalism as the carpenter picks up another hammer to drive a nail but he doesnt the carpenter dont build a house just to drive nails
he drive snails to build a house
would you say peyton place was justified in the in the sensationalism
have you read that
i dont know the book but if they are flesh and blood people if he was trying to write about human beings rather than about sensation in the sensationalism yes i will accept and pass
but if he was just trying to write sensationalism then that s another horse do you have time to read quite a bit
plenty of time
i dont do it
i read the books i knew and loved when i was a young man read them over and over
the new one sidon t dont keep up with too well unless someone tells me this is a good book you should read it
then i will stop and read it when you read these books you ve read before do you find new things in them constantly
in the sense that you find new things in in old friends that is there s some reason that you like togo back and spend an hour or two with an old friend
it may not be be for anything new unless the evocation with a little more experience on your own part will will throw a new light on to something that you thought you knew before and you find now you didnt that you maybe know a little more about truth that what the good writers say to the young man he knows instinctively are true things later on as he knows a little more he knows why they re true and in that sense it is something new yes could you give us some of the titles of these books mr faulkner
yes m
i read don quixote ever year
i read the old testament
i read some of dickens ever year an dive got a portable shakespeare a one volume shakespeare that i carry along with me
conrad
moby dick
chekhov
madame bovary some of balzac almost every year
tolstoy
i haven th a vent thought of art zy bash evin years
i think ill get the him out and read him again art zy bash ev
gogol
most of the frenchmen of the nineteenth century i read in every year
you must ve read some of erskine caldwell once upon a time
i did yes
when he first began to write and the stuff was first rate i did
i read a lot of it
i read a lot of all my coevals at that time
sorry
well go ahead here then
sir of the new books you say you occasionally read have you found any in the last few years that you regard as superior books superior writing
i remember one about a destroyer in the pacific by i believe he was a virginia man ey ster
that was i thought thought a pretty good book
theresa young man in mississippi named shelby foote that shows promise if hell just stop trying to write faulkner and write some shelby foote and yes ive seen a seen a few books but i dont remember titles nor writers too well
i remember characters and and incidents that seem to be me to be true which is the test
im sorry there were were you next
or you
well sir you then what about the greek tragedies
do you ever enjoy reading those
when i was young yes
i have nt haven tread it any of the greek tragedies in along time
but when i was young yes sir we take for granted do you read primarily the books that you ve read you say when you were younger or the books of times gone by
you dont think terribly highly of the books that are put out say in the last twenty years
well i dont know you see because i haven th a vent seen them
its simply because as as the writer grows old ive heard other writers say this too they read less and less
i dont know why that is but but most writers as they grow old they seem to read less and less
its not that they re in different to their to their juniors its it cant be any jealousy because i think that any sincere writer has has failed to do what he d like to do
that is it its not better than was ever done before but he has enough belief in his in his craft his avocation to be convinced that behind him someone is come coming that will do it that may do it
and as is a yi its not because i dont like to read anymore
i simply read less than i did
and when ido read its its when there s nothing better to do you might say and so ill pickup the book just to pass time
when i was younger i was an avid reader because i was learning
that was the way i learned my craft
i read everything i could get my hands on to see how it was done what to do
sir what do you think of aristotle s theories about tragedy
there s wide dispute about that now with death of a salesman do you think he s right or
what theory is this that that a tragedy must the hero must beaman of high place so that he can fall all the further
well i dont think aristotle meant by high place what what it sounds like
i think he meant a man of of integrity more than a than a man of aristocracy unless is that what you meant by high place well that s what i say
i believe he does mean money wise and society wise rather than integrity but im not an authority on that but that swell i think that was because he used the high place the money the riches or the title as as symbols that a that a king must be brave a queen must be chaste as simple symbols as puppets
but tragedy as aristotle saw it its i would say is the same conception of tragedy that all writers have it its man wishing to be braver than he is in in combat with his heart or with his fellows or with the environment and how he fails
at the splendor the courage of his failure that and the trapping of royalty of kingship were simply trappings to make him more splendid so that he was worthy of of being selected by the gods by olympus as an opponent that man couldnt cope with him so it would take a god to do it to cast him down
im interested in the relationship between your observation about the critical process as being primarily an imaginative one in which you you do not simply try to hold a mirror up to a particular character in the scene but in which your product is the product of your imagination which is in the background the product of all that you ve learned this you you ve said meant that means that if a writer sets a pattern for himself and sees the pattern of the whole work then his writing becomes merely a matter of swatting it out
does this mean for example that paradise lost in which the pattern was set is to a large extent merely a matter of swatting it out or that any man who like spenser in the faerie queen conceives of an idea as the objective rather than the production of the mere product of imagination does this mean also that spenser did just swatting it out
i dont think so
i dont think that the pattern as he sees it is that rigid that the pattern is a is a general idea within accepted or circumscribed limits but not rigid limits
they re simply circumscribed
that that the imagination must be checked by something and the pattern conform or or meet or be amicable well say and when one has to give i believe its always the pattern that has to give and so he s got to rewrite to create a new pattern with a bulge that will take this this bulge of the imagination which insists that its true
it must be
before i ask this question id like to say that i really agree with what you said a while ago about the races in the south
carlyle i believe said of words that indignation makes verses
do you also think that indignation makes great novels
yes mit depends on what the indignation is toward
if its indignation toward a condition it doesnt always make a great novel
it could maybe
its got to bean indignation at at mans condition not his particular situation but a this condition
its something that s that s got to be strong enough to raise the steam to make the artist assume the anguish and trouble and travail of putting something down on paper or in music or to paint it or to hack it out of a piece of marble
that s could be indignation but its its indignation at mans condition i believe not at at a particular instance of injustice or cowardice
that might be the germ in which an individual the conception of a man the idea of an individual against that temporary condition could make the book but that book didnt create the individual
the individual is the tool to show the condition
did you ever find yourself surprised at repeating yourself when you say by jove i did that thing better twenty five years ago or by jove this is better than it was twenty five years ago
no because tome there a in t any better
its either good or its nothing and its what i did twenty five years ago didnt suit me and so i forgot that
i mim working on another one i hope that this one is going to be the right one
of course i know it a in t but the one twenty five years ago is under the bridge
its too bad but there s nothing i can do about it anymore except write a new one mr
faulkner do you think the author has the prerogative to create his own language in other words togo against what the people create vernacular
do you think an author has the right to create his own i believe joyce and eliot have done it have tried to create they found that language was not did not suit their purpose so they had togo beyond and make their own language
he has the right to do that provided he dont insist on anyone understanding it that that is what im trying trying to say is that i believe im paraphrasing whitman didn the say to have good poets we must have good readers too something like that
who knows great audiences
that swell the writer actually that san an obligation that he assumes with his vocation that he s going to write it in away that people can understand it
he doesnt have to write it in the way that every idiot can understand it every imbecile in the third grade can understand it but he s got to use a language which which is accepted and in which the words have a specific meaning that everybody agrees on
i think that finnegans wake and ulysses were were justified but then its hard to say on what terms they were justified
that was a case of a genius who was electrocuted by the divine fire
its often been said about great novels or great short stories that they wouldnt pass muster in the freshman english composition course
now i was wondering since this is your first day at the university if you had any comments on the traditional or the apparently traditional conflict between the creative writer and the school man
well as an old veteran sixth grader that question is i think out outside of my province because in ever got to freshman english
i dont knowhow much it would conflict
maybe before ive left the university i will be able to pass freshman english
with more and more capable negroes coming to the fore in all facets of the public life do you believe that half a dozen capable negro fiction writers could do a world of good for the segregation problem
ido yes out of seventeen million people and some of them becoming very adequate physicians and lawyers dont you believe that they can develop some writers of stature also
ido yes
i think that people like armstrong and dr ralph bunch e and george washington carver have done much more for the negro race than than all of the naacp leaders much more
and there s no reason at all why why the negro shouldnt produce good writers
he has got to have he has got to be freed of of the of the curse of his color
he she s got to have equality in terms that he can get used to it and forget that he is a negro while he s writing just like the whiteman has nt got time to remember whether he s a gentile or a catholic while he s writing
and the negro has got to reach that stage and the whiteman s got to help him because he cant do it by himself under these conditions he s in the best position to write sympathetically about his own conditions
he should be yes but you cant write sympathetically about a condition when its when its a constant outrage to you you see
you ve got to be objective about it
ido yes
they they didnt give him success but they gave him something a lot more important even in this country
they gave him serenity
they gave him what would pass for wisdom
i mean wisdom as contra distinct from the school mans wisdom of education
they gave him that
no
nono children that had been transmitted to him
in away every every little eight or ten year old boy was his son his child the ones that he taught how to hunt
he had passed on what he had
he was not trying to tell them how to slay animals
he was trying to teach them what he knew of of respect for whatever your lot in life is that if your lot is to be a hunter to slay animals you slay the animals with with the nearest approach you can to dignity and to decency mr
faulkner i think you were speaking about the act of creation a while ago sometimes were ad that many authors seem to create with a with a high degree of objectivity and that other authors have the feeling that when they re going about this process they are almost in the very act of experiencing literally the things that their created people are experiencing
in some of of the people that you ve created that you have enjoyed doing most or felt you hit off most truly have you ever had the illusion or the feeling that in the act of creation that the sensations were you were experiencing them almost as if this act were literally happening to you
not exactly because when my people come alive they take charge of what were doing and im going at a dead run to keep up and put down what they do and say
i dont have time to think much about myself in this business
im too busy trying to keep up with them that they they talk and act too fast
im afraid that if is top for a minute ill miss something and i know that i cant invent it because they ve taken charge
they redoing the inventing by that time
im just the secretary by then
sir you say you invent that
well i imagine this might come of one of your very very long sentences but yet you say they revery carefully contrived
well what do you do
get down what comes out and the ngo back and work over it
that s right perfect it
that s right
its i think that probably goes back to the burden which man carries all his life is the knowledge of death
that is he knows that he wont live forever and he s found something so amazing and so moving which is breathing or being being in the world apart of it and in away he is attempting to write the whole history of the human heart on the head of a pin because he think she may not last long enough to put it down on anything as big as a piece of paper
also i think that a man at any moment of action is the living sum of his past that and the reason for for the long sentences that go so far into the past and into the future is that belief that man at the very moment at which he is doing something he did that particular thing exactly in that way because of the hundred years before him that made him and that s simply a matter of trying to remind the reader that this man is complete in motion only because he is the sum of his ancestors and his condition his times do you often find that you can improve on what you ve originally put down
oh yes yes
i think any writer keeps at it until he knows that that s thebes the can do
it may not be good enough but when he realized that s thebes the can do then he moves on to the next sentence or the next paragraph that s not exactly what i meant
i mean you say you write as fast as you can to get it out and then you go back and buildup the constructions in there and nono
i didnt mean that
i mean that i dont like to the mechanics of putting the stuff on paper and i try to get it in shape in my mind before i take the do the work
i didnt mean that i scribble and then went back over it and and edit it no its its done as much as possible mentally until it begins to sound right
then i put it down
sir in your writing you you find you get very close to people and draw people as you think they are
what do you think of the approach of men like mencken and shaw who really or possibly im wrong but i dont think they retrying to give the public a picture of people
they re rather trying to slap them in the face a little bit and paint in extremes
well they were were using the tools of their trade as they believed they were the best tools
i think that that shaw was trying to write about human beings in the in the light of his own intelligence and his own wit and his own distaste for certain conditions
i think that mencken was still a a constantly angry indignant man more he was first that he was only second a critic or a sociologist
he was mainly just a madman
shaw of course wasnt
shaw was was an artist
you mentioned a while ago in noting some of the books that you liked particularly madame bovary and also tolstoy
i take from what you also said that the things you admire about these two very different artists would be the fact that they both hit the truth flaubert in his extremely precise oh yes tolstoy in his almost shapeless way
would you would you say something about your own preferences or attitudes toward the different extremes of craftsmanship in war and peace as opposed to bovary
well in bovary is aw or thought is awam an who wasted nothing who was whose approach toward his language was almost the lapidary s that he was he whether he had the leisure i dont know exactly for what the what the term i want that is a man who who elected to do one book perfectly in the in the characters and in the method in the style as as against a man who was so busy writing about people that he didnt have much time to bother about style and when he did attain style he was just as astonished as anybody else
though that comparison i grant you is better between flaubert and balzac maybe
well i think of the man that wrote salam m bo and the latent ation de st antoine and madame bovary was a stylist who was also had had enough talent to write about people too
but everybody cant do that
everybody cant do both
you have to choose maybe what shall ido
shall i try to tell the truth about people or shall i try to tell the truth in a in a chalice does the luxuriance of the foliage in war and peace offend your sense sense of craftsmanship
no
no nothing im not enough of a conscious craftsman to remember that i have ever been offended by by any style or or method
that i think that the moment in in the book the story demands its own style and seems tome just as natural as the moment in the year produces the leaf
its when melville become sold testament biblical that seems natural tome
when he becomes gothic that seems natural tome too and i had nt really had nt stopped to think now where does one change and become another
though with with the bovary its as though you know from the very first as soon as you see what is going that he will never disappoint you that it would be as as as absolute as mathematics
you filled the full hour and thankyou
well well begin by asking mr faulkner questions raise your hand if you have one
this is sort of a question of motivation for the writer and many of the best southern writers write about the degeneration of the old aristocracy and its determination to live and to think according to the old traditions and standards
now do you think that this continued determination on the part of those around him causes the writer to revolt against this system and accordingly is it a does this attitude does it furnish a motivation for writing
it does in that that is a condition of environment
its something that is handed to the writer
he is writing about people in the terms that he s most familiar with
that is it could have sociological implications but he s not too interested in that
he is writing about people
he is using the material which he knows the tools which area th and and so he uses the instinct or the desire or what whatever you will call it of the old people to be reactionary and tory to stick to the old ways
its simply a condition
and since it is a condition it lives and breathes and it is valid as material
siri believe you were in europe in at the sametime as anderson and hemingway and others
at that time did you associate with them and if not was there any specific reason why you were not thrown together and do you think that that group was influenced or influenced each other in anyway as from their association
they may have
i think the artist is influenced by all in his environment
he s maybe more sensitive to it because he s has got to get the materials the lumber that he s going to build his edifice with
i at that time i didnt think of myself as a writer
i was a tramp then and i didnt i wasnt interested in literature nor literary people
they were i was there at the sametime
i knew joyce i knew of joyce and i would goto some effort togo to the caf that he inhabited to look at him but that was the only literary man that i remember seeing in europe in those days
how did s ut pen get all his money in wedding for the wedding in the rain
it was said that he got it by robbing showboats i think but how did he get i think that he looted his father in laws caribbean plantation
i think that his drive to revenge himself on the on the man who had told him togo around to the backdoor by establishing a dynasty of his own and he was ruthless about it and he probably picked out the easiest money he could get and one quick way to get some of it was to marry the daughter
another quick way instead of waiting for the oldman to die to loot the plantation which i think he did and he probably brought it to the mainland and hid it and whenever he needed more money he would go and dig up a little more of it
it was probably in bullion gold jewels maybe
but im sure that s the way he got it
would you say that much writing is the result of unrest within the writer
i think its all a result of unrest in the writer
i think think the writer is demon driven that he cant beat peace unless he is trying to take the sorry shabby world which he finds and he cant change it physically so he can can create a world of his own in which people are are braver or better blackguards or better heroes or more chaste or better villains than he finds in the world around him
he s demon driven i think is this ever really satisfying him
yes what satisfies him is the belief that this time he s going to create that world which will match the dream
of course it dont and so he writes another book tomorrow
that one wont either and hell write another one
maybe if he ever did write one that pleased him he would be miserable
nothing else to do
sir it has been argued that arose for emily is a criticism of the north and others have argued saying that it is a criticism of the south
now could this story shall we say be more properly classified as a criticism of the time
now that i dont know because i was simply trying to write about people the writer uses environment what he knows and if theresa symbolism in which the lover represented the north and the and the woman who murdered him represents the south i dont say that s not valid and not there but it was no intention of the writer to say now lets see im going to write a piece in which i will will use a symbolism for the north and another symbol for the south that he was simply writing about people a story which he thought was tragic and true because it it came out of the out of the human heart of human aspiration the human the conflict of of conscience with with glands with the old adam
it was a conflict not between the north and south so much as between well you might say god and satan
sir just a little more on that thing
you say its a conflict between god and satan
well i dont quite understand what what you mean there
who is did one represent the
the conflict was in miss emily that she knew that you do not murder people
she was she had been trained that that you do not take a lover you marry
you dont take a lover
she had broken all the the laws of her tradition her background and she had finally broken the law of god too which says you do not take human life
and she knew she was doing wrong and that s why her her own life was wrecked
instead of having murdered one lover and then togo on and and take another and when she used him up to murder him she was expiating her crime
but cant a person like miss emily though she did do all the things that she had been taught not to and being a sensitive sort of a woman it was sure to have told on her but do you think its fair to feel pity for her because in away she made her adjustment and it seemed to have wound up in a happy sort of away certainly tragic but maybe it suited her just fine
yes it may have but then i dont think that one should withhold pity simply because the subject of the pity object of the pity is pleased and satisfied
i think the pity is in in the human striving against its own nature against its own conscience that s what deserves the pity
its not the fate of the individual
its man in conflict with his heart or with his fellows or with his environment that s that s what deserves the pity
its not that the man suffered or that he fell off the house or was run over by the train
its that he was that man is trying to do thebes the can with his desires and impulses against his own moral conscience and the the conscience of the social conscience of of his time and his place the little town he must live in the family he s apart of in the bear was there a dog are all ion
yes there was
i can remember that dog
i was about the age of that little boy and he belonged to our pack of bear and deer dogs and he was a complete individualist
he he didnt love anybody
the other dogs were all afraid of him
he was a savage but he he did did love to run the bear
yes i remember him quite well
he was mostly airedale
he had some hound and lord only knows what else might ve been in him he was a tremendous big brute stood about that high
must ve weighed seventy five or eighty pounds
in any bear hunt that lion participated in did he ever perform heroic action like the one in the story
no not really
theresa case of the sorry shabby world that dont quite please you so you create one of your own so you you make lion a little braver than he was and you make the bear a little more the bear than he actually was
i mim sure that lion could have done that and and would have done it and it maybe at times when i wasnt there to record the action he did do things like that
this question is also concerned with the bear
in the conclusion of the story ike m cc asl in finds boon destroying his rifle
now i was wondering if this incident just showed that boon could not so you say compete with the mechanical age or whether this was showing the end of an order the fact that lion and that old ben were dead that the hunters were nt returning to the cabin anymore and the land had been sold to a lumber company
a little of both
it was that boon with the mentality of a of a child a boy of of sixteen or seventeen couldnt cope not only with the mechanical age but he couldnt cope with anytime
also it tome it underlined the the heroic tragedy of the bear and the dog by the last survival being reduced to the sort of of petty comedy of someone trying to patch up a gun in order to shoot a squirrel
that made the tragedy of of the dog and the bear a little more poignant tome
that s the sort of tour de force that i think the writer is entitled to use
sir the other day you said that you dont try to inject yourself into a situation about which you rewriting and and feel how you might react if you were a certain person
you said you didnt do that
is it do your characters do their actions come about strictly from an an unconscious feeling on your part or do they just flow out or
i prefer to think that the characters are area live enough to stipulate and postulate their own behavior and actions that the actions of of course they come from my own experience of people but i prefer to think that the characters by that time have taken charge of the story and that they re ones that are saying what they would do and what they will say that all they need then is someone to trot along and put it down
that actually it wouldnt be tome much fun in inventing figures just to project my own ideas
these ideas i grant you are mine but but they are the lumber in in the attic that in the carpenters workshop
now and then he needs aboard so he reaches back and finds it and sure enough it fits
that is he has to cut it and trim it a little but it fits
i know that you ve stated that you dont read the critics regarding your own work
however i wonder what ideas you have regarding the aims or the proper function of a literary critic not only of your works but shall we say of others as well
i would say he has a valid function a very important function but but tome he s a good deal like the minister
you dont need to listen to him unless you need him and i in my own case i know i have already decided about the value of my work
there s nothing anybody can tell mei dont know about it and the critic nori either can improve it any by that time and the only way to improve it is to write one that will be better next time and so im at that and i probably just dont have time to read the critic
sir when you started to write did you write to say something to other people or did you write mostly for your own satisfaction
because it was fun i became a writer by a chance
ive told this story before some of you may have heard it i was running whiskey for a new orleans bootlegger back in prohibition days and i met sherwood anderson and i liked him from the first
we would meet in the afternoons and we would walk around new orleans and and he would talk and i would listen
then in the evening we would meet and weds it somewhere and drink and he would talk and i would listen
in the morning he would be in seclusion working and that went on day after day and i thought that if that was what a writers life was that would be the life forme and so i wrote a book and and after the first day or two i found out that writing was fun
it was just about the nicest thing anybody could do and i was having so much fun at it that i even forgot about mr
anderson
i had nt seen him in oh several weeks and i met mrs anderson on the street and she said we have nt seen you in sometime
i said yes mim writing a book
so is a wher again on the street and she said it old sherwood you were writing a book and sherwood said my god and is a wher later on
she said how s the book getting along
i said im just about to finish it
and she said do you want sherwood to read it
i had nt thought about anybody reading the thing because it was fun and i said yes mi dont mind if he wants to so she told him about it
is a wher again and she says sherwood says if he dont have to read it hell make a trade with you
if he dont have to read it hell tell his publisher to take it
so i said done
and so he told mr live right to take it and that show i got published but by that time id found out that writing was fun to do and that that was simply my cup of tea an dive been at it since ever since mr
faulkner did they take it just the way it was or yes m now what would you have done if they had asked you to make changes
well i dont know because i had lost my bootlegging job or the i believe the federal people finally caught him and i had a job as an ordinary seaman in a freighter then
i was i spent the next year or two in ships and by that time i was working on another book and so i was got out of touch with this one
i dont i reckon i would ve changed it probably if the publisher had said if you make a few changes well print it i probably would
siri think you said that you have nt yet achieved your own personal goal as a writer
what is that goal and is it likely that you will succeed or achieving it
that s difficult to say its its when i have done something that to use hemingway s phrase makes me feelgood that is that is completely satisfactory
maybe that will be the goal and i hope just a little that ill never quite do that because if ido there wont be any reason togo on writing and im too old to take up another hobby its i think that a writer wants to make something that he knows that a hundred or two hundred or five hundred a thousand years later will make people feel what they feel when they read homer or read dickens or balzac tolstoy that that s probably his goal
i dont think that he bothers until he get sold like this and has the right to spend a lot of time talking about it to put that into into actual words but probably that s what he wants that really the writer doesnt want success that he know she has a short span of life that the day will come when he must pass through the wall of oblivion and he wants to leave a scratch on that wall k il roy was here that somebody a hundred or a thousand years later will see
sir why do you regard the sound and the fury as your best work
it was the best failure
it was the one that i anguished the most over that i worked the hardest at that even when i knew i couldnt bring it of fi still worked at it like the parent feels toward the unfortunate child maybe
the others others that have been easier to write than that and in ways are better books than that but i dont have the feeling toward any of them that ido toward that one because that was the most gallant the most magnificent failure
you said that eventhough you did not bring it off you worked hardest at it
how do you feel that you failed to bring the sound and the fury off
it dont make me feelgood enough to use hemingway s phrase
that s a condition that probably i cant put into words but if i ever do strike it i will know it
i think that s true of any writer well arent there parts of it that make you feelgood enough
well that s not enough parts of it are not enough
it must be all you see
you cant compromise you know its its either good or it a in t
there s no degrees of goodness
its either all right or its not all right
how do you feel about a fable
the fable was i dont have the same feeling toward that because the fable was a book that came out of an idea
the others were came out of people
the fable was an idea and at that time i felt that i had learned enough about my craft to do it about as well as as anyone could have done it and that s tome a satisfactory book but it it it doesnt move me like the sound and the fury did
the sound and the fury is one book that i would like to write over i know i couldnt do it better
but the fable noi dont want to write that anymore can you make any comment on the part that the old general plays in a fable
he seemed tome to take two distinct different parts if not more in the theme of passion week including the three temptations would you care to elaborate at all on that character
well tome he was the dark splendid fallen angel
the good shining cherubim tome are not very interesting
its its the dark gallant fallen one that is moving tome
he was an an an implement really
what i was writing about was the trilogy of mans conscience represented by the young british pilot officer the runner and the quartermaster general
the one that said this is dreadful terrible and i wont face it even at the cost of my life
that was the british aviator
the old general who said this is terrible but but we can bear it
the third one the battalion runner who said this is dreadful i wont stand it ill do something about it
the old general was satan who had been cast out of heaven and because god himself feared him well what the thing that had puzzled me was that going back as far as i could gather he also had been the father of the corporal
yes that s right and that is what had somewhat puzzled mein the allegorical that was apart of of satan s fearsome ness that he could usurp the legend of god
that was what made him so so fearsome and so powerful that he could could usurp the legend of god and then discard god
that s why god feared him
would you care to say anything about the allegorical function of the horse in the fable
he seems to have some very complex or interesting characteristics
not to meno
that was simply another struggle between man and his conscience and his environment
the horse was simply a tool
that is that foul and filthy cockney hostler was still capable of love for something
that if he had maybe if he had had a better better childhood a better better background he might ve been capable of better love of something more worthy than than a horse
but he was capable of love for one thing that he could sacrifice to and could defend eventhough it was only a horse mr
faulkner in the story red leaves in the indian burial ritual would it have brought disgrace to that had the manservant committed suicide during the chase
tell me that again
during the in the in the short story red leaves yes i know during the burial the burial ritual yes would it have brought disgrace to that whole ritual had the manservant committed suicide during the chase before they caught him
no they could still have brought his body back and immolated that
no they were simply cleaning house that was what the rule said when the chief went back to the earth his body servant and his dogs and his horse went with him
no it would have been no disgrace
it in fact if he had done that quicker they would ve been pleased because it would have saved them all the trouble of tracking him back and forth through that swamp which they didnt want to do
they were a lazy indolent people and there wasnt any use of anyone causing all that trouble when he couldnt getaway
what is your purpose in writing into the first section of the sound and the fury passages that seem disjointed within themselves the ideas not connected with one another
that was part of the failure
it seemed tome that the book approached nearer the dream if the groundwork of it was laid by the idiot who was incapable of relevancy
that si agree with you too that s a bad method but tome it seemed the best way to do it that i shifted those sections back and forth to see where they went best but my final decision was that though that was not right that was the best to do it that it was simply the groundwork of that story as that idiot child sawi the himself didnt know what he was seeing that the only thing that held him into any sort of reality into the world at all was the trust that he had for for his sister that he knew that she loved him and would defend him and so she was the whole world to him and these things were flashes that were reflected on her as in a mirror
he didnt know what they meant
you spoke a minute ago of the writer seeking to leave some creative mark on on posterity
i was wondering if you think that the effect on the artist is better today when he can somehow achieve his immorality immortality during his lifetime because the communication being so much wider and greater than formerly when perhaps the writers fame came to him long after his death and maybe he was the only one during his lifetime that was satisfied with his work
i dont think so
i believe the writer takes a longer view than that
he a in t too interested in in what the contemporary world thinks about it
he has a longer view that he he is aimed not at at jones of but at jones of orwell do you think that the you would have been just as satisfied if your work maybe had never been discovered until
i think so sure
yes
of course the when they began to bring in a little money that was nice i liked the money but the glory the rest of its not very valuable
well then thinking that this period doesnt matter too much do you go back over the things and you still have a lot of time left to work over the ones that you ve already written
do you go back and worry about them and wish you had done them differently
i wish i had done them better but i dont have time to worry about it too much
that s just a constant thought or or belief that i would like to be able to do them over again
that is not togo back and take one single book and write another version of it but if i could go back to say when i started that i could do a better job
of course i wouldnt but that san idle thought that occurs only when i have nt gotten anything better to do
the the best thing is to write another book to do it
because it takes only one book to do it
its not the sum of a lot of scribbling
its its one perfect book you see
its its one one single urn or shape that you want to do
you said that when you wrote the fable that you you had an idea and you made the characters develop the plot through that and that you did that because you thought you knew your trade well enough by that time to do that
now does that mean that when you first start out that you think that its better to make the characters shape the plot and sort of let it unfold as
ido yes
unless you have an extremely interesting and moving idea which to mei thought i had in the fable was the thought just suppose that had been christ under the cenotaph with the eternal fire burning and and all the temporarily well known world figures to come and put a wreath of moribund flowers on it
suppose that had been christ crucified again
that would be twice and would we have another chance
but its best i think for the writer to write about people
that s that s your trade you know
your craft is to write about people
they re infinitely interesting
they re infinitely capable of diversion of change of aberrations
yet they re intrinsically the same thing
its the same heart the same anguish the same desire to be better than you are the same passion that the heart feels the same ambition aspiration hope
that s what you rewriting about
yes m when you do write about people that way well of course you dont have to put up with the critics but i noticed particularly that when a new book comes out all these freudian implications are pulled out and all sorts of undercurrents rather than just the simple here s what happened and and of course there s always more to it than that but all kinds of weird things are just pulled out of the hat and thrown around
does that bother you
does it disturb you that everything is sort of misconstrued
i cant say because im not aware of it
i dont dont read the critics
i dont know any literary people
the people i know are are other farmers and and horse people and hunters and we talk about horses and dogs and and guns and and and what to do about this hay crop or this cotton crop not about literature
i think im convinced though that sort of criticism whether its its nonsensical or not is valid because it is a symptom of of of change or motion which is life
and also its a proof that literature art is a is a living quantity in our social condition
if it were not then there the red be no reason for people to to delve and find all sorts of symbolism s and psychological strains and currents in it
and im quite sure that there are some writers to whom that criticism is good that it could help them find themselves
i dont know that the critic could could teach the writer anything because im inclined to think that nobody really can teach anybody anything that you offer it and its there and if and if it is your will or urge to learn it you do and the writer that does need the criticism can get quite a lot of benefit from it
in that evening sun is the ditch symbolic al of the color line
could be but you see i then he will need observation
he uses that but i dont believe that he he himself knows or has time to know just how much of which was where and when
when you were out in hollywood did you have anything to do with televising some of your stories
i heard that you
now they have been televised have nt they
yes every now and then i hear about one
i dont have a radio and television so i dont keep up with what goes on but i hear now and then that they have been on tv
sir what are the spotted horses symbolic of if anything
as spotted horses i dont know
i that maybe symbolic al but as horses that was they they symbolized the hope the aspiration of of the masculine part of society that is capable of of doing of of committing puerile folly for some gewgaw that has drawn him as juxtaposed to the cold practicality of of the women whose spokesman mrs little john was when she said them men
or what fools men are
that the man even in a society where theresa constant pressure to conform can still betaken off by the chance to buy a horse for three dollars
which tome is a good sign i think
i hope that man can always be tolled off that way to buy a horse for three dollars
what sort of reading do you best enjoy
do you have much time for the work of contemporary novelists
noi dont
i haven tread a contemporary book in twenty odd years unless someone says this is a good book
i think you would like it and so i will get that book and read it but ive got out of the habit of keeping up with with contemporaries because in ever was a literary man in the sense of of of needing to keep abreast of the establishment of literature
tome reading is like writing ido it for fun
im not too interested in in what anybody else has done that i read books because its fun how about the classics
the classics
i read the books that i liked when i first began to read and they are yes what ranks as classics now meaning by that any book that people still read after a hundred or two years
sir could you suggest any books that one read first in order to get a clearer and more comprehensive picture of your complete works and if there are any why these specific choices
there are none
i think the best way to read noi cant say the best way this is the way i read
i take the book and i can tell within two or three pages if i want to read that book now
if i dont i put that down i take another
i would say to take faulkner that same way and read a page or two until you find one that you want to read another page
it would be difficult for anyone except an expert to plot out a schedule for you
i would do it that way i think
sir do you have any solution for a man to find peace if he cannot write as you
well i dont think the writer finds peace
if he did he would he would quit writing
maybe man is incapable of peace
maybe that is what differentiates man from a vegetable
though maybe the vegetables dont even find peace maybe there s no such thing as peace that it is a negative quality that and i understand
iam speaking of peace in his own heart
yes well i mim inclined to think that the only peace man knows is he says why good gracious yesterday i was happy
that at the moment he she s too busy
that maybe peace is only a condition in retrospect when the subconscious has has gotten rid of of the the gnats and the tacks and the broken glass in experience and has left only the peaceful pleasant things
that was peace
maybe peace is not is but was
do you enjoy reading shakespeare
i heard you speak of homer
i was just wondering how you felt yes m
i still read shakespeare
i have a one volume shakespeare that i have just about worn out carrying around with me
i think you told somebody once that if you had a you were writing something and you had something to getup to every morning and goto work on you d never have to be afraid of anything in the world anymore
and i wonder what you meant by that
i mean by that that out of idleness that if you have something to getup to tomorrow morning you re too busy to pay much attention to fear
of course you you have the fears but you have you dont have time to take them too seriously if you have something to getup to do tomorrow it dont matter too much what it is
and if its something that you yourself believe is valid in the sense that the artist believes what he s doing is valid in that it may do something to uplift mans heart not to make man anymore successful but to temporarily make him feel better than he felt before to uplift his heart for a moment
yes s iroh yes ma amin the bear is the possession and destruction of the wilderness a symbolic indication of any sort of corruption in the south
and if this is true what sort of prognostication does this have for the future of the south or of the country as a whole
well of course the destruction of the wilderness is not a phenomenon of the south you know
that is a change that s going on everywhere and i think that man progresses mechanically and technically much faster than he does spiritually that there maybe something he could substitute for the ruined wilderness but he has nt found that
he spends more time ruining the wilderness than he does finding something to replace it just like he spends more time producing more people than something good to do with the people or to make better people out of them
that that s tome is asad and tragic thing for the for the old days the old times togo providing you have the sort of background which a country boy like me had when that was apart of my life
that i dont want it to change but then that s true of everyone as he grows old
he thinks that the old times were the best times and he dont want it to change
is your short story death drag based on an actual event or experience in your life
not too much
they were i did a little what they call barnstorming in the early days after the war when aeroplanes were not too usual and people would pay a hundred dollars to betaken for a short ride in one but i dont remember anything that was specifically like this
this was again a human being in conflict with his environment and his time
this man who hated flying but that was what he had to do simply because he wanted to make a little money
what symbolic meaning did you give to the dates of the sound and the fury
now theresa matter of hunting around in the carpenters shop to find a tool that will make a better chicken house
and probably im sure it was quite instinctive that i picked out easter but that i wasnt writing any symbolism of the passion week at all
i just that was a tool that was good for the particular corner i was going to turn in my chicken house and so i used it
sir you mentioned some of the russian authors before
what do you think of dostoevsky do you consider him one of the best
he s one that has not only influenced me a lot but that i have got a great deal of pleasure out of reading and i still read him again every year or so
that as a craftsman as well as as his insight into people his capacity for compassion
he was one of the ones that any writer wants to match if he can
that she was a one that wrote a good k il roy was here
there saline in was that i wonder if you would explain something about it that to mey st url says to cass
anytime you wants to get something done from hoeing out a crop to getting married just get the womenfolks to working at it
that all you needs to do then all you needs to do is set down and wait
well that s good advice but does he use it in this story
does to mey st url get the womenfolks to work for him
well im sure he would if he d had time but people were were running him with dogs so much and harrying and harassing from pillar to post he didnt have time but if he could have could ve got the men to stop long enough then miss soph on sib a would have settled that whole thing
she would have taken uncle buck home and then to mey st url and ten nie could have gotten married and things would have been settled
it was the men that kept things stirred up
probably to mey st url knew that soon as the dust settled no matter what was the outcome of that poker game miss soph on sib a and uncle buck would get married and that then he and ten nie would be let alone
is requiem for a nun going to be put on as a play
it has been knocking around europe for about five years
i wrote that not as a play but as another of the carpenters tools which seemed tome the best way to tell a story
there was a young woman
she was a a friend a sweetheart of of my youngest brothers that i knew of vaguely around home in oxford and she s trying to bean actress and so she asked me to let her do it as a plays oi gave her the rights to it and that s why it has never been in the states because she has nt got enough reputation for anyone to put up the money that a play in this country costs
it willi assume reach here in time sooner or later but you have nt got any idea of your own about how it should be put on or whether there should be a chorus used
no mim not a playwright and in ever saw but three or four plays in my life
i wonder if you could comment on who you think in say two hundred years from now will leave the biggest k il roy s were here
of this century which writers will leave the biggest k il roy if any
i dont want to answer that question because im too unfamiliar with with contemporary writers
i haven tread any contemporaries since the three or four of my time and so often are mark like that in simple talk it gets out and someones feelings have been hurt that the man that spoke it had no intention of hurting because he didnt even know he existed and so for that reason ii wouldnt answer that question at all i would say that i think that sherwood anderson has not received the recognition that he deserves and someday will have what about hemingway
hemingway now he she s alive and that s where id better stay out of trouble by saying nothing you see would you say anything about your own writings or would you hurt your own feelings
noi still haven td one it but i intend to live to be about a hundred years old so ive got forty more years yet
by that time ill answer your question if you re still around
thankyou very much mr faulkner
siri come from india an dive been trying to read a good many of your books
the problem iam finding it extremely difficult to follow the narrative method that you adopt
is it true to say that you adopt a lyrical method to a narrative and a novel is also a narrative of certain events and what the characters do what happens to them
we find that in a novel like as i lay dying or the sound and the fury or the sanctuary that its difficult to follow the event
is it true to say that you follow the lyrical method while trying to tell a story
ami correct
noi think the writer is concerned first in telling about people people in conflict with themselves and with others with their environment and he uses whatever method seems to him the best to tell what he is trying to tell in the most dramatic and passionate way that he is not trying to use a lyrical method deliberately
it may seem to him best to use a lyrical method or maybe the result of of his own agony and anguish to say what he wants to say becomes lyrical
who is the central character of ab salom ab salom
it seems so obviously to be s ut pen yet its been said that its also the story of quentin and i was wondering just who is the central character
the central character is s ut pen yes
the story of a man who wanted as on and got too many got so many that they destroyed him
its incidentally the story of of quentin comp sons hatred of the bad qualities in the country he loves
but the central character is s ut pen the story of a man who wanted sons
sir in the same book i was wondering what is supposed to be the readers attitude towards mr coldfield the father of ellen
well my attitude is that he was a pretty poor man
i dont know what the readers attitude might be but i still felt compassion and pity for him but he was a poor man in my opinion
sir what sort of a deal was made between goodhue coldfield and s ut pen in reference to the bill of lading
it looked like they pulled some sort of deal
i dont remember
that book is so long ago tome but but coldfield was a petty grasping man and s ut pen was a bold ruthless man and s ut pen used coldfield s pettiness for his s ut pens ends but i dont remember exactly what it was mr
faulkner sir in light in august the central character joe christmas had most of his troubles and his persecutions and in his search to find himself was based on his belief that he was part negro and yet its never made really clear that he is
was he supposed to be part negro or was this supposed to add to the tragic irony of the story
i think that was his tragedy
he didnt know what he was and so he was nothing
he he deliberately evicted himself from the human race because he didnt know which he was
that was his tragedy
that tome was the tragic central idea of the story that he didnt know what he was and there was noway possible in life for him to find out which tome is the most tragic condition a man could find himself in not to know what he is and to know that he will never know sir if he is not does not definitely have negro blood well what is the significance of gavin stevens s surmise there at the end when he explains that theresa conflict of blood
that that is only a guess that stands for a guess and not a final knowledge of yes yes that is an assumption a rationalization which stevens made
that is the people that destroyed him made rationalizations about what he was
they decided what he was
but christmas himself didnt know and he evicted himself from mankind
i dont remember
i dont remember that
let me think a minute i dont remember whether c ly tie was any relation to charles bons mother
that s so long ago too they have the same father
well then yes that would be the reason of course
do you think that a comparison can justly be made between joe christmas and charles bons son
is there much in their behavior you think that s similar
there again you have me
i dont remember
they re both so long ago and that s one good thing about being a writer
you can get rid of one book you dont have to read again
mr faulkner in working out the situation of joe christmas did you deliberately have in mind a correspondence between his situation and oedipus for example as has recently been brought out in an essay published in the quarterly magazine
no not deliberately and not consciously
that s another matter of the writer reaching back into the lumber room of his memory for whatever he needs to create the character or the situation
the and the similarity is there but it was not by deliberate intent
it was by by coincidence not accident but by coincidence
along those same lines i noticed a similarity between s ut pen and heathcliff from emily bront es wuthering heights and i was wondering if there s any intentional similarities here at all
i dont know
i dont know wuthering heights
in ever read it thankyou
in wild palms there is a passage strongly reminiscent of the grand inquisitor in dostoevsky s brothers karamazov the import of which seems to condemn not christ but organized religion
in light in august much of the action seems to stem from almost fanatical calvinism
would it be true to surmise that you favor strongly individual rather than an organized religion
ido always then you think perhaps that man must workout his own salvation from within rather than without
ido yes
siri have often wondered through what process the author actually goes when he writes a book
could you briefly outline what process you go through
now i know i cant
i mim lazy
i hate to the mechanics of putting the words down on paper and ido as much of it as possible in my head
i will that is putting it down on paper is the last resort
ive got to get it out of my system and so i dont know what system i might use mentally to get the facts in order to bring the mass of material into the the form according to the rules of of unity and emphasis
i just dont know some people work from notes
they they make notes and then correlate the notes and then edit and then write and then do a draft
i dont do that
i try my best not to have to change anything because im lazy i think that i dont like to work how many times do you rewrite the hundreds of drafts
sometimes the first one is all right
sometimes i will do three or four or five until it comes right but i will try my best not to do it but once because i hate to work
in another class you stated that you seldom have the plot of your novels worked about before you begin to write but that they simply develop from a from a character or an incident
i was wondering if you remember what character or what incident caused you to write ab salom ab salom
s ut pen you thought about the character yes the idea of a man who who wanted sons and got sons who destroyed him
the the other characters i had to get out of the attic to tell the story of s ut pen
do you ever consciously base your any of your characters either major characters or minor characters on people you find in everyday life
for example during your time spent in charlottesville could you possibly incorporate someone who lived here into one of your major books as a conscious exercise
i will very likely do it but not as a conscious exercise
the writer is completely amoral
he he will use experience
he will rob from other writers
he will take from life but he is trying to create a character of his own and so very likely in time i will will need someone i have seen in charlottesville virginia and will without any compunction use him
ive been looking for s ut pens the reason for s ut pens downfall and it seems tome that the civil war plays apart in it
is that is that true
yes but that s not that s not the main reason
not his i used the civil war to for my own ends there
s ut pens ut pens country was wrecked by the civil war but that didnt stops ut pen
he was still trying to get the son still trying to establish a dynasty
he was still trying to get even with that man who in his youth had said goto the backdoor
sir in light in august much of the action comes back to the scene or the picture of a column of yellow smoke coming up from joanna burdens cabin
i was wondering you had said that in sound and the fury you got the idea for the story from seeing a little girl like caddy in a tree
i was wondering if that happened with light in august
perhaps that was the scene that you had seen and that you started from in that story
no that story began with lena grove the idea of of of the young girl with nothing pregnant determined to find her sweetheart
it was that was out of my my admiration for women for the courage and endurance of women
as it old that story i had to get more and more into it but that was mainly the story of lena grove
in ab salom ab salom what was the significance of s ut pen pitting himself against his negro servants the wild negro servants and especially in that scene where ellen happened in when he had brought the children there to watch it
was that another example of the decadence of the south
no not not by intent
that was another instance of s ut pens ruthlessness of his will his implacable will to create a dynasty and fill it with sons and i thought of of rather these which seemed tome dramatic or or amusing or tragic incidents invented themselves as props for s ut pens will implacable will to get the son
in sanctuary is the character of popeye emblematic of evil in a materialistic society or what would he stand for
no he was to mean other lost human being
he became a symbol of evil in modern modern society only by coincidence but i was still writing about people not about ideas not about symbols siri ve been told that the title of light in august came from a colloquialism for the completion of a pregnancy
is that true
noi used it because in my country in august theresa a peculiar quality to light and that s what that title means
it has in a sense nothing to with the book at all the story at all
how do you pronounce the name of your mythical county
if you break it down into syllables its simple
yo kn a pata wp hay ok napa taw pha
its a chickasaw indian word meaning water runs slow through flat land
what was the particular significance of having of having wash jones a very humble man be the instrument through which s ut pen me this death
is that to relate back to the social stratum from which s ut pen himself came and have there a sort of ironic effect
just what was the idea of that
in a sense
in another sense wash jones represented the man who survived the civil war
the the aristocrat in the columned house was ruined but wash jones survived it unchanged
he had been wash jones before and after he was still wash jones and s ut pen finally collided with him
sir in some of your stories you ve used scenes where in two or more people are sitting around or across from each other at a table orade skin a very darkroom where perhaps only the hands can be seen in the lighting
i was wondering if that sort of scene meant anything to you or that you felt that you could use that particular scene for a certain type of information in your story or just what
i think maybe instinctively i like understatement
maybe i have a feeling for for somber ness
probably ido but ido like to tell things as simply by by understatement to tell to show just the surface with with the dark implications behind it of an instance or scene mr
faulkner do you believe that the south of today is the south of people like wash jones and the s nope s clan or do you think do you still think there s noble blood there
i think that its mostly the south of wash jones and s nope ses but there s theresa the something left by the the older braver people that appears now and then but its a country mainly of s nope ses and wash jones es
they survived
the the quality that was left by the old brave aristocratic people shows occasionally
nobody knows where it might when it might appear or where from
in light in august do you feel that reverend high tower dies feeling that he has achieved a certain kind of salvation received some sort of salvation mr faulkner
he didnt die
he had had wrecked his life
he had failed his wife
he had failed himself but there was one thing that he still had which was the the brave grandfather that galloped into the town to burn the yankee stores and atleast he had that everything else was gone but since he had been a a man of god he still tried to beaman of god and he could not destroy himself
but he had had destroyed himself but he still couldnt take his own life
he had to endure it to live but that was one thing that was pure and fine that he had was the memory of his grandfather who had been brave
so much of the story in ab salom ab salom
is reconstructed by s hr eve and quentin
how does the reader know which to accept as objective truth and which to consider just a reflection of their personalities
well the story was told by quentin tosh re ve
s hr eve was the comment the commentator that held the thing to something of reality
if quentin had been let alone to tell it it would have become completely unreal
it had to have a a solvent to keep it real keep it believable creditable otherwise it would have vanished into smoke and fury
i cant say just where it was that i had to put it down that i decided i didnt know enough at that time maybe or or my feeling toward it wasnt passionate enough or pure enough but i dont remember at what point i put it down
though when i took it up again i almost rewrote the whole thing
i think that what i put down were inchoate fragments that wouldnt coalesce and then when i took it up again i as i remember i rewrote it
that s possible but i dont remember just how much of the first i rewrote when i began the second time mr
faulkner i would like to ask you to identify a quality forme
iam thinking of a sentence toward the end of the bear
iam going to read part of the sentence so that you will understand what i a masking about
there was a boy who wished to learn humility and pride in order to become skillful and worthy in the woods he suddenly found himself becoming so skillful so rapidly that he feared that he would never become worthy because he had not learned humility
then finally it goes on until an oldman who could not have defined either had led him as though by the hand to that point where an old bear and a little mongrel of a dog showed him that by possessing one thing other he would possess them both
what is that one thing other
courage thankyou very much
that was the little dog that yes
i wondered if it was pity or truth mr faulkner
courage it was
the little dog that never saw a bear bigger than he was
is the title of ab salom ab salom
taken from the passage in the bible found in second samuel
yes did you write the novel with this episode in your mind or did you first write the novel and then realizing the similarity of the name they were simultaneous
as soon as i thought of the idea of the of the man who wanted sons and the sons destroyed him then i thought of the title
did you expect to write a anymore poetry
and if so are there any particular subjects you d like to see in your poetry
im a failed poet
i consider myself a failed poet
ive tried to be a poet and i couldnt be a good one and so i did the next best thing which i could do but im still a failed poet but what i write is in my opinion poetry
what do you consider your best book
the one that failed the most tragically and the most splendidly
that was the sound and the fury the one i worked at the longest the hardest that was tome the most passionate and moving idea and made the most splendid failure
that s the one that s my i consider the best not well best is the wrong word that s the one that i love the most i wanted to ask something about that
was it very difficult to write the stream of consciousness part of benjamin
nono
not not once i understood ben jy and understood the story it was very simple very easy that s such a difficult part to understand unless someone shows you no it was very easy to do
that s probably why its so hard to read
i think anything that is easy to do is perse probably bad but i couldnt think of any better way to tell about ben jy
i was trying to tell a story
i tried that way
that wasnt enough
i tried with quentin
that wasnt enough
i tried with jason
that still wasnt enough and then i tried faulkner and that still wasnt enough it still failed and that s why i love it mr
faulkner sir most people are very struck by your change of style in light in august
for example you use the present tense to tell the story in rather than the past
was that did you mean something by that or were you just using a new form for dramatic import or
no that just seemed tome the best way to tell the story
it wasnt a deliberate change of style
i dont know anything about style
i dont i think a writer with with a lot to pushing inside him to get out has nt got time to bother with style
if he just likes to write and has nt got anything urging him then he can become a stylist but the ones with a great deal pushing to get out dont have time to be anything but clumsy like balzac for instance mr
faulkner in ab salom ab salom when s hr eve and quentin are reconstructing the story for each other they setup a lawyer who was directing the campaign of charles smother to gain revenge against s ut pen
was there really a lawyer do you think or is it just a product of their imagination as they reconstructed the story
im sorry i dont remember that they speak about the man who was counseling charles smother in trying to get back at s ut pen
there probably was a lawyer
i dont remember that book but yes yes there was a lawyer
that sounds too logical in mississippi terms
yeshe was there would have been lawyer there
sir what is your personal reaction to situations such as being in a classroom when you discover that a lot of people who ve read into your novels things that you didnt intend them to read
interest i didnt know about all these things and so im quite interested to hear that they were in there
they must ve been in there for people to find them do you feel that perhaps you ve failed in in just plain telling your story or that perhaps you ve done more than you realized
not ome it wasnt told as well as it should ve been told and that s why i write another one
the one that i have finished that s that s water under the bridge and im not interested any longer because that wasnt good enough
